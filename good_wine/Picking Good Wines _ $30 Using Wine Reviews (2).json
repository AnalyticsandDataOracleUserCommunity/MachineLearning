Voss\t@vossroger\tQuinta de S?œo Sebasti?œo 2013 Sub??idio Red (Alentejano)\tPortuguese Red\tQuinta de S?œo Sebasti?œo\tLT_90_Points\tThink of Subs??dio as a contribution rather than as a subsidy, says the producerƒ??in this case a contribution to a meal. The wine is soft and fully ripe. It has generous tannins and black fruits. The rich wine, with its juicy aftertaste, is ready to drink.\n101628\tGermany\tD?¬rkheimer Michelsberg Trocken\t89\t26\tPfalz\t\t\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tPfl?¬ger 2014 D?¬rkheimer Michelsberg Trocken Riesling (Pfalz)\tRiesling\tPfl?¬ger\tLT_90_Points\tThe D?¬rkheimer Michelsberg bottling maintains the richness of texture and body of many of Pfl?¬ger's dry Rieslings. It's concentrated in apple and pear flavors, but zestier acidity and an herbal freshness lend a leaner, edgier feel. Drink now through 2019.\n112285\tFrance\tChevalier Famaey\t85\t12\tSouthwest France\tC??tes du Lot\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?›teau Famaey 2013 Chevalier Famaey Malbec (C??tes du Lot)\tMalbec\tCh?›teau Famaey\tLT_90_Points\tAlthough based in Cahors, Ch?›teau Famaey uses this looser C??tes du Lot appellation for this easy, fresh and fruity wine. It has ripe berry fruits with a light touch of acidity and tannin. Drink now.\n10701\tFrance\tVall??e des Rois\t84\t11\tLoire Valley\tTouraine\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tAlbert Besombes 2016 Vall??e des Rois Sauvignon Blanc (Touraine)\tSauvignon Blanc\tAlbert Besombes\tLT_90_Points\tThe wine has bitterness from the intense acidity and herbal character. That shows its youth and this intensity will calm down as the ripe fruit softens. It will be a perfumed wine with a softer texture from spring 2018.\n50429\tUS\tThe Reserve\t87\t25\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\t14 Hands 2013 The Reserve Chardonnay (Horse Heaven Hills)\tChardonnay\t14 Hands\tLT_90_Points\tThe new American oak barrel fermentation and aging steals the show on this wine. Notes of vanilla and woodspice overpower the variety's melon and apple aromas and flavors. There are some good things going on but it's hard to get at them.\n78724\tUS\tNemarniki Vineyard\t92\t33\tOregon\tChehalem Mountains\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tLaelaps 2015 Nemarniki Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tLaelaps\tGT_90_Points\tRight on the heels of their excellent 2014 version, this ups the ante still further. Young and forward, it's nonetheless well-balanced and ready for prime-time drinking. Bright raspberry and cherry fruit abounds, with the freshness and supporting acidity to age nicely for up to a decade.\n585\tUS\tStevensSteel\t89\t25\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tStevens 2016 StevensSteel Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)\tChardonnay\tStevens\tLT_90_Points\tThis is an expressive example of this variety, especially considering the stainless steel aging. The aromas are bright, with notes of apple, pear and melon. The cantaloupe flavors are broad and fleshy, lingering on the finish. It brings a lot of appeal.\n47936\tUS\tThe Dissident\t88\t28\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tMark Ryan 2006 The Dissident Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tMark Ryan\tLT_90_Points\tThis mongrel is 50% Red Mountain Syrah, 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Merlot. Tight and tart, it has a slightly reduced, rubber ball character, and needs plenty of breathing time. Fruit flavors are raspberry and cassis, accented with sharp acids and stiff tannins.\n23211\tAustralia\tThe Vagabond Old Vine\t90\t50\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThistledown 2013 The Vagabond Old Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tThistledown\tGT_90_Points\tJust tiny amounts of this wine (25 cases) are available in the U.S. market, but it represents a trend in Australia of celebrating old-vine Grenache. A blend of two parcels from the Blewitt Springs and Seaview subregions, this is silky in texture, with crisp red cherries shot through with herbal streaks and a slightly warm finish.\n38374\tChile\tGrey Glacier Single Block\t90\t20\tMaipo Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVentisquero 2013 Grey Glacier Single Block Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVentisquero\tGT_90_Points\tSpicy aromas of eucalyptus, juniper, asphalt, toasty oak and berry fruits are textbook for the Maipo Valley. This is tight and focused on the palate but a bit rough. Rooty spice, chocolaty oak and herbal berry flavors finish full and with tannic scratch. Drink this well-executed Cab through 2021.\n101814\tUS\tBien Nacido Vineyard\t87\t45\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tLongoria 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)\tPinot Noir\tLongoria\tLT_90_Points\tWith an earthiness that weighs down the cherry, cola and currant flavors, this Pinot tastes a bit heavy. It's properly dry, with good acidity and modest alcohol.\n76671\tUS\t\t85\t18\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tFelten Cellars 2012 Zinfandel (Paso Robles)\tZinfandel\tFelten Cellars\tLT_90_Points\tThis Zin has candied, fruit punch flavors of cherries, licorice, raisins, brown sugar and cinnamon. It's a robust wine, mouthfilling and heady, that's best paired with barbecue.\n123842\tUS\t\t91\t36\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tAncient Peaks 2013 Petite Sirah (Paso Robles)\tPetite Sirah\tAncient Peaks\tGT_90_Points\tFrom the Wittstrom Vineyard northwest of Paso Robles, this rich and accessible bottling shows lavender, lilac and violet potpourri on the nose, with black cherry and balsamic notes Baked blackberry and blueberry flavors show on the palate, where chalky tannins carry milk chocolate and Concord grape notes long into the finish.\n56678\tFrance\tSec\t91\t15\tLoire Valley\tVouvray\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine de la Gaverie 2014 Sec  (Vouvray)\tChenin Blanc\tDomaine de la Gaverie\tGT_90_Points\tTight, young and tangy, this wine will be delicious when it all comes together. The elements are all there, with the quince and pear fruits, intense acidity and the crisp texture that is so refreshing. Drink this ageworthy wine from 2017.\n60246\tItaly\t\t87\t33\tTuscany\tRosso di Montalcino\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tPoggio Antico 2014  Rosso di Montalcino\tSangiovese\tPoggio Antico\tLT_90_Points\tSubdued aromas of French oak, underbrush, espresso and menthol lead the way. The rather lean but polished palate offers tart sour cherry, vanilla and roasted coffee bean alongside vibrant acidity and firm tannins that grip the finish.\n68724\tUS\tGeorganne\t93\t57\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tMerry Edwards 2010 Georganne Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tMerry Edwards\tGT_90_Points\tShows a certain aggressiveness, offering up vibrant raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, mocha and oak flavors, but kept aloof by its acidity and tannins. It's certainly elegant and pedigreed, but it need 3ƒ??4 years in the cellar.\n74408\tFrance\tVilla Chambre d'Amour\t87\t13\tFrance Other\tVin de France\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLionel Osmin & Cie 2013 Villa Chambre d'Amour White (Vin de France)\tWhite Blend\tLionel Osmin & Cie\tLT_90_Points\tVery perfumed, this lightly sweet and poised wine is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Gros Manseng. It has cool acidity as well as wonderfully fragrant fruitiness. The texture gives the wine the potential to age, so drink now and until 2017.\n17057\tPortugal\tPinta Negra Branco\t85\t19\tLisboa\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tAdega M?œe 2014 Pinta Negra Branco White (Lisboa)\tPortuguese White\tAdega M?œe\tLT_90_Points\tFresh and fruity, the wine is attractive, citrus-driven and light. It has a zesty character that zings through the palate. Drink now.\n2293\tItaly\t\t90\t32\tTuscany\tVino Nobile di Montepulciano\t\t\t\tLa Calonica 2006  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano\tPrugnolo Gentile\tLa Calonica\tGT_90_Points\tThis deeply saturated wine opens with a nice balance of ripe, chewy fruit, vanilla and spice. The wine promises to evolve over time, giving more space to the mineral nuances you can already detect now. Tones of licorice, black spice and clove are lively and intense in the mouth.\n28397\tAustria\t\t88\t19\tWachau\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\t@AnneInVino\tJ??ger 2015 Ros?? (Wachau)\tRos??\tJ??ger\tLT_90_Points\tFaint notes of white pepper and bay leaf create an aromatic introduction to this delicate ros??. The slender palate delivers red apple and a pleasant hit of citrus which lingers beautifully.\n3253\tItaly\tCeppeto Riserva\t86\t31\tTuscany\tChianti Classico\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tMannucci Droandi 2009 Ceppeto Riserva  (Chianti Classico)\tRed Blend\tMannucci Droandi\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of Sangiovese and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of forest floor, ripe blackberry, cedar and menthol. The warm, evolved palate offers dried black cherry, licorice, mint, ground pepper and a gamy note alongside assertive, almost gritty tannins that leave an astringent finish.\n12580\tAustria\tGamlitzberg\t87\t24\tS?¬dsteiermark\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\t@AnneInVino\tStrauss 2014 Gamlitzberg Gelber Muskateller (S?¬dsteiermark)\tGelber Muskateller\tStrauss\tLT_90_Points\tSummer blossom, honeysuckle, even rose petals appear on the aromatic nose. The slight and slender palate is poised and comes on very light feet. This is a breezy, easy summer wine to be drunk as soon as possible.\n62342\tUS\t\t90\t15\tOregon\tOregon\tOregon Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tA to Z 2016 Pinot Gris (Oregon)\tPinot Gris\tA to Z\tGT_90_Points\tSometimes less is more, and sometimes more is more, as in this 68,000-case offering from A to Z. It's a leesy, pretty, highly gulpable wine, loaded with apple, pear and melon fruit.

This one may soon fall into the latter category, but before it gets there look for peppery white-fruit aromas and flavors. Tastes of honeyed melon are  topped with cracked black pepper.

Let it air in your glass, and watch how it changes. One minute it's all cherries and smoke; the next it heaves up a great draught of currants, cocoa and cedar. It's a big wine but deceptive; the tannins are airy and lilting, there's charm and underneath, enormous complexity.

It combines some toasty, smoky characters with herbal notes on the nose, then develops flavors of wax, spice and citrus, lingering elegantly on the finish. Tasty now, but might develop even more interesting complexities with additional age.\n2982\tAustralia\tHyland\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenley Estate 2013 Hyland Shiraz (Coonawarra)\tShiraz\tPenley Estate\tGT_90_Points\tMouthfilling and round, this wine's savory notes of roasted meat, mocha and cracked pepper frame plummy fruit.

This one is full bodied and rich, with dense plum and chocolate notes that verge on being fudge-like. But those elements are lifted slightly by hints of mint and bacon. Mocha joins the party on the long finish. Drink nowƒ??2025.\n356\tAustralia\tGeorgia's Paddock\t95\t85\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJasper Hill 2013 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tJasper Hill\tGT_90_Points\tDusty, firm, powerful: just a few apt descriptors for this vintage of one of Heathcote's top wines.

Instead, it's concentrated through age and should hold in the bottle indefinitely.

The masses of dark fruit are reined in by crisp acids and a layer of supple tannins, adding depth to the cassis, vanilla and mint flavors.

The 2012 Chard is a bold yet elegant wine, filled with grilled pineapple and citrus fruit and framed by hints of toasted nuts, vanilla and graphite.\n15204\tAustralia\tThe Fifth Wave\t94\t53\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2013 The Fifth Wave Grenache (Barossa)\tGrenache\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tGrenache is being treated with more and more respect around Australia, which means more bottlings are reaching the variety's potential. Gentle herbal notes intertwine with bunches of black cherries and a hint of vanilla in this medium- to full-bodied example. Hints of red peppercorn capture a unique combination of fruit and spice, while the finish is long and crisp.\n17775\tAustralia\tThe Virgilius\t92\t45\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2015 The Virgilius Viognier (Eden Valley)\tViognier\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tThis is Yalumba's flagship Viognier, barrel-fermented for an extra layer of richness. Fig, melon and apricot notes mark the nose and palate, and while it is fully ripe and weighty, it carries its alcohol well. Fruit intensity easily balances the oak, which remains almost invisible.\n17776\tAustralia\tTitan\t92\t28\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAlpha Crucis 2014 Titan Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAlpha Crucis\tGT_90_Points\tWhile the trend among many Australian Cabernets is towards moderate, silky tannin structures, this austere, firm wine embraces its dry, dusty nature.

In 2007, it's a full-bodied, richly textured wine filled with raspberry, cherry and chocolate aromas and flavors. Based on its somewhat chewy finish, it should last and evolve through at least 2020.\n16312\tAustralia\tEligo\t94\t100\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2013 Eligo Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied, creamy and lush, this is a prototypical Barossa Valley Shiraz from a longtime master of the variety.

It's meaty and stalky, with raisiny dark fruit, cocoa powder and Dr. Pepper notes. The palate changes directions but is equally delicious in juicy cranberry, earth and herbs, with tightly grained tannins and lively acidity.\n21463\tAustralia\t\t92\t200\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCloudburst 2013 Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tCloudburst\tGT_90_Points\tOnce past the sticker shock, enjoy this wine for its richly toasty aromas, plush tropical fruit and warm, lingering finish.

This is fine stuff, a bit funky at first, but opening up in the glass to reveal hints of brown-sugar-glazed pineapple and fresh citrus. It's medium to full in body, with a long, almost painfully crisp finish that brings all that fruit into bright, refreshing focus.\n24478\tAustralia\tShay's Flat Vineyard\t90\t36\tVictoria\tPyrenees\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTournon by Michel Chapoutier 2012 Shay's Flat Vineyard Shiraz (Pyrenees)\tShiraz\tTournon by Michel Chapoutier\tGT_90_Points\tAs one might expect from a Rh??ne-based producer, this is a meaty, earthy rendering of Shiraz.

Lucky/persistent lotto winners will experience a medium- to full-bodied red with a velvety mouthfeel, cassis, vanilla and cedar notes and something akin to charred tomato.\n23970\tAustralia\tThe Signature\t94\t54\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2008 The Signature Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tAlways one of Yalumba's top offerings, the 2008 doesn't show any of the vintage's ill effects. Instead, this blend of Cabernet (56%) and Shiraz (44%) offers a rich, open-knit mouthful of chocomint and dark plum, underscored by savory, meaty notes. This is full bodied and supple, yet muscular, with at least a decade of cellaring potential.\n26539\tAustralia\tArt Series\t93\t89\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2013 Art Series Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tAs always at Leeuwin Estate, the Art Series Chardonnay is a star. Now incorporating some natural ferments and slightly more solids, the 2013 features some more savory elements than in the past.

This is a fruit-driven Cabernet, loaded with black cherries and cassis and supported by restrained, just-right oak levels. It's medium-bodied, softly dusty yet firm, with a surprisingly long finish.

It's full-bodied but silky-soft in texture, with aromas and flavors that range from plum to earth and cola to dried spices. The tannins melt away on the palate, leaving behind a long, mouthwatering finish. Drink now.\n28131\tAustralia\tReserve\t90\t40\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStonier 2005 Reserve Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tStonier\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine nicely captures Pinot Noir's elusive silky texture and weight without heaviness, then combines those attributes with complex earthy flavors and touches of sassafras and cola.

Hints of vanilla and graham crackers accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is long and mouthwatering. There's ample concentration, yet the wine never seems heavy. Drinkable now, but why rush things? Drink 2020ƒ??2030.\n25614\tAustralia\tBlack Clay\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2013 Black Clay Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tSt Hallett\tGT_90_Points\tAn excellent value, this is a fairly full-bodied, slightly creamy-textured Shiraz that should provide ample pleasure through 2020.

A medium-bodied wine with a long, mouthwatering finish, it's a tasty near-term drinker but should develop well for up to 10 years.\n25351\tAustralia\tEligo\t94\t100\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2008 Eligo Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tDuval used to make Grange, so it is no surprise that his current luxury Shiraz is so successful. The 2008 Eligo oozes with oaky sweetnessƒ??vanilla, maple syrup and brown sugar notesƒ??but balances that with potent cassis fruit and somehow ends on dry, savory notes of tobacco and spice. Drink now-2018, although it could surprise and go longer.\n24564\tAustralia\tGun Metal\t91\t19\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHewitson 2015 Gun Metal Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tHewitson\tGT_90_Points\tThis light- to medium-weight wine is drinkable nowƒ??try it with Coffin Bay oysters if you canƒ??but should also age well for up to 15 years.

Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tJansz\tGT_90_Points\tThere aren't many better values in ros?? sparklers than this. Hints of toast and citrus add nuance to strawberry scents on the nose, while brioche notes add depth to the palate.

A sense of plumpness unfolds on the attack, then accelerates across the palate in a burst of bright, citrusy acids. A tactile, silky edge to the finish adds length and complexity.\n26126\tAustralia\tD Block Reserve\t90\t50\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tShingleback 2005 D Block Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tShingleback\tGT_90_Points\tThis is an impressively endowed wine, but one that will have to rely on age for its complexity. Right now, its fruit (blackberries and cassis) is a bit simple upfront, then adds crisp acidity and firm tannins on the finish. Try in 2010.\n24571\tAustralia\t\t91\t30\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMaison L'Envoy?? 2015 Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tMaison L'Envoy??\tGT_90_Points\tFor a cool-climate Pinot Noir, this is ripe, rich and round. Its ample weight delivers broad, complex flavors of clove, cinnamon, black cherry, plum and cola, but its oaky overcoat may dissuade purists. Although the fruit comes from Tasmania, the wine was made on the mainland at Giant Steps in the Yarra Valley. Drink nowƒ??2023.\n24574\tAustralia\tThe Merle\t91\t40\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPikes 2014 The Merle Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPikes\tGT_90_Points\tPike's top Riesling features aromas of crushed stone and damp moss, while the flavors bring to mind tangy limes and underripe nectarines. It's actually a bit rounder in feel than expected, then gains focus on the long finish.\n26517\tAustralia\tEstate Vineyard\t93\t154\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiaconda 2014 Estate Vineyard Chardonnay (Victoria)\tChardonnay\tGiaconda\tGT_90_Points\tMusky, spicy notes of pineapple and clove set the stage, expanding on the palate alongside waves of cinnamon, vanilla and peach.

Grass and mineralƒ??even waxyƒ??flavors freshen up the palate, and floral and saffron notes waft from the nose. Lemon rind and viscous sour apple flavors linger on the finish. For this range of flavors to work in harmony, you surely must count elegance and subtlety among its virtues.\n29778\tAustralia\tStonehorse Estate Grown\t92\t37\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKaesler 2010 Stonehorse Estate Grown Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tKaesler\tGT_90_Points\tEndowed with plenty of fruit, this wine swirls together notes of raspberry and vanilla, then tops off that delicious blend with hints of mint and other herbs.

This is full and velvety, with hints of cedar and vanilla blending easily into the whole. Approachable now, it should age well through at least 2025.\n29786\tAustralia\tBin 389\t92\t50\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2009 Bin 389 Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (South Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tBin 389 is always a Cab-Shiraz, although the 2009 is only just, at 51% Cabernet and 49% Shiraz. This year's version is chocolaty and ripe, with plenty of weight and a slightly creamy feel. Cassis and vanilla notes fill out the palate, which finishes long, with an elegant texture akin to fine suede. Drink nowƒ??2025.\n27428\tAustralia\t\t91\t29\tWestern Australia\tMount Barker\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2009 Shiraz (Mount Barker)\tShiraz\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tDarker, sterner and less accessible than Plantagenet's Omrah bottling, the winery's flagship Shiraz offers substantial dark fruit flavors reminiscent of espresso, plum and cracked pepper. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 2ƒ??3 years of cellaring. (The 2007 is drinking well now.)\n28185\tAustralia\tTribal Elder\t92\t70\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStrathewen Hills 2004 Tribal Elder Shiraz (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz\tStrathewen Hills\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky and meaty, this is aggressively savory in style, but really evolves with air to show a gentler, raspberry-fruited side accented by dried spices. It's medium- to full- bodied, with a slightly creamy texture and silky, mouthwatering finish. Terrific cool-climate Shiraz.\n27189\tAustralia\t\t90\t12\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRazor's Edge 2008 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tRazor's Edge\tGT_90_Points\tA terrific value if you like the style, this is an impressively concentrated, slightly syrupy Shiraz imbued with potent cassis fruit and framed with vanilla oak. Surprisingly long on the finish.

The 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz delivers layers of mixed berries, baking spices and hints of dried fruit and toasty oak. It's full-bodied, lush and creamy-textured in the mouth, with a long finish powered by fruit and shaped by dusty tannins. Drink now-2020.\n31602\tAustralia\t\t90\t16\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tEarthworks 2013 Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tEarthworks\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2013 entry-level Shirazes from Barossa provide a great opportunity for wine consumers to rediscover Australia. This one is solidly structured and savory, boasting hints of black olive, dark chocolate and espresso. The finish is completely dry and firm, suggesting it'd be a fine accompaniment to beef or lamb. Drink nowƒ??2025.\n29225\tAustralia\tPrelude Vineyards\t92\t36\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2012 Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis is remarkably lush and full-bodied, yet remains lively and mouthwatering. Toasted nuts frame ample flavors of grilled pineapple and melon. Drink nowƒ??2017. The success of this wine should be a good indicator that, when released, the 2012 Art Series will be something spectacular.\n29274\tAustralia\tCullen Vineyard\t90\t35\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCullen 2011 Cullen Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)\tSauvignon Blanc-Semillon\tCullen\tGT_90_Points\tDespite its relatively low alcohol level, this comes across as reasonably mouthfilling and rich. Smoky notes from barrel fermentation emerge with air, accenting white nectarine and citrus fruit. It's one of the few blends of this type to show the textural interest of a good white Graves.\n32497\tAustralia\t\t94\t40\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\t\t\tGroom 2001 Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tGroom\tGT_90_Points\tClassic Aussie Shiraz from the vineyard that borders the backbone vineyard of Penfold's Grange. This one's made by ex-Grange winemaker Daryl Groom, who now lives in California's Sonoma County but owns his own Australia vineyard. Lush, deep, rich and ripe, the wine fans out to reveal complex layers of black cherry, plum, licorice, spice, chocolate, blackberry, tar, vanilla, coconut and herbs. Smooth and plush textured, with a finish that doesn't quit.\n32263\tAustralia\tRobinson\t93\t55\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoorooduc 2013 Robinson Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)\tChardonnay\tMoorooduc\tGT_90_Points\tDespite its moderate alcohol level, this comes across as medium to full in body, with a velvet and custard texture that coats the palate with flavors of grilled pineapple, citrus and melon. It's made in a concentrated, opulent style, yet it finishes clean, with lingering notes of citrus. Drink now through 2020.\n31270\tAustralia\tChurch Block\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2013 Church Block Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Merlot-Shiraz\tWirra Wirra\tGT_90_Points\tAt 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a firm, cassis-scented wine, but one that includes hints of ripeness and generous fruit. Dried herbs and brown sugar add nuance, while the velvety finish picks up some meaty, savory notes.

Full-bodied with powdery tannins, it has flavors of honeydew, peach fuzz and mineral, and an herbal-peppery finish that lingers on the tongue. Nose is a tantalizing mix of marzipan, jasmine and clover. Just excellent.\n31307\tAustralia\t\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKaesler 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKaesler\tGT_90_Points\tThis amply endowed, creamy-textured Cab may not make old bones, but it offers a delicious mouthful of rich cassis fruit, accented by hints of mint, tobacco and dark chocolate. It's silky enough to drink now, with a long, slightly warm finish.\n31816\tAustralia\t\t90\t25\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\t\t\tBird in Hand 2015 Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tBird in Hand\tGT_90_Points\tGive this wine a few minutes to open up, and once it does it's a lovely example of cool climate Chardonnay. Subtle notes of ripe lemon, stone fruit, butter, and smoke lead into a slippery textured, medium-weighted palate. More lemon and stone fruit mark the flavors, and toast and smoke show on the finish.\n33677\tAustralia\tThree Blocks\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFox Creek 2014 Three Blocks Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFox Creek\tGT_90_Points\tThis seems a bit oaky on the nose, where scents of baking spices and cedar dominate, but those elements are balanced out on the palate, where blackberries, plums and black currants comes to the fore. This is a full-bodied, ripe-textured wine worth a look. Drink nowƒ??2025.\n33627\tAustralia\tThe Galvo Garage\t91\t29\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2009 The Galvo Garage Red (Adelaide)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tPrimarily Cabernet Sauvignon (the balance is Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc), this is full bodied, lush and richly textured. Cassis, blackberry, vanilla and tobacco leaf notes give this a convincingly Bordeaux-styled profile, although much riper and plusher. Drink nowƒ??2023.\n31587\tAustralia\tNative Goose\t90\t24\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCape Barren 2013 Native Goose Red (McLaren Vale)\tRed Blend\tCape Barren\tGT_90_Points\tAt only 6%, the Mataro is mostly window-dressing, but this blend of Grenache (52%) and Shiraz (42%) is still a tasty mouthful. Toast and cedar notes frame black cherry and plum fruit in this full-bodied, lushly textured wine. Drink nowƒ??2018.\n30904\tAustralia\t\t91\t36\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2010 Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tAmple vanilla notes from oak aging mark the nose and palate of this savory Shiraz.

Richardson\tGT_90_Points\tDark and smoky on the nose, with meat, cedar and blackberries combining into an attractive bouquet. This is a meaty, savory wine that should drink well from 2010ƒ??2020, backed by tart blackberries and showing some dusty tannins on the finish.\n34630\tAustralia\tArt Series\t91\t22\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2013 Art Series Riesling (Margaret River)\tRiesling\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tLike an underripe nectarine, this tart, crunchy wine needs a bit time to mature. But instead of 2ƒ??3 days, think 2ƒ??3 years. Lime and mandarin orange notes are lean and crisp on the palate, austere for now, but surely going to blossom in time.\n34260\tAustralia\tKeyneton Euphonium\t94\t65\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2013 Keyneton Euphonium Red (Barossa)\tRed Blend\tHenschke\tGT_90_Points\tIt's nice to see the quality of this wine reach new heights, as it's still relatively affordable within the Henschke context. The blend includes Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. The 2013 shows a slightly austere side, an aristocratic reserve, but the flavors are classic. Pencil shavings, mint, cassis and cigar box finish with great drive, length and dusty tannins. Drink 2023ƒ??2035.\n34404\tAustralia\t\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2009 Viognier (Eden Valley)\tViognier\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tShows all the beautiful Viognier notes you could ask for: flowers, spice, apricot and melon, carried by a succulent mouthfeel that remains fresh and vibrant from start to lingeringly spicy finish.

It's lemony and crisp on the long, austere finish. Drink now with oysters, or cellar for 5ƒ??10 years.\n36656\tAustralia\tThe Cigar Menzies Vineyard\t92\t26\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2013 The Cigar Menzies Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tMenzies is the name of Yalumba's Coonawarra estate, which is almost entirely devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon. Like most of the Yalumba wines, the oak levels have been pared back in recent vintages, allowing this wine's cassis fruit to to shine. Hints of tobacco, bay leaf and sage bring complexity, while the tannins are fine, adding a softly dusty feel to the long finish.\n35391\tAustralia\tThe Beast\t92\t75\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHentley Farm 2007 The Beast Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tHentley Farm\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2007 is full bodied and rich, but not really Beast-like at this stage of its evolution.

Hints of vanilla and mint accent the fruit without detracting from it, as does a subtle layer of mocha. Long and layered on the finish; drink nowƒ??2020.\n36693\tAustralia\tGeorgia's Paddock\t91\t85\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJasper Hill 2014 Georgia's Paddock Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tJasper Hill\tGT_90_Points\tReally youthful, with almost grapy aromas buttressed by mocha and lifted, slightly leafy notes. This is a big wine, marked by thick, chewy tannins on the finish, but they never obscure the flavors of grape skins, tapenade and mocha. Try after 2018.\n35173\tAustralia\tThe Lucky Lizard\t90\t22\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2011 The Lucky Lizard Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tDespite this wine's modest alcohol level, it delivers ample richness and flavor. Hints of toast and roasted nuts frame vibrant citrus fruit and a touch of white peach. It's intense and invigorating, with a burst of fresh citrus echoing on the finish.\n38269\tAustralia\tJulius\t90\t37\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2012 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tHenschke\tGT_90_Points\tThis is surprisingly plump and accessible, featuring scents of lime rind upfront, then flavors of apple, nectarine and citrus. A medium-bodied wine with a long, mouthwatering finish, it's a tasty near-term drinker but should develop well for up to 10 years.\n38056\tAustralia\tThe Lodge Hill\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\t\t\tJim Barry 2002 The Lodge Hill Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tJim Barry\tGT_90_Points\tThough it's crisp and fresh in the mouth, this wine has some weight (and some oily viscosity) to it. Starts off in the mouth with a burst of sweetness, and a limey, grassy streak carries it through to the finish. Nose is fruity, with nectarine and mango highlights.\n37183\tAustralia\t\t91\t33\tSouth Australia\tPiccadilly Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPetaluma 2010 Chardonnay (Piccadilly Valley)\tChardonnay\tPetaluma\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a lush, ripe Chardonnay from a cool subregion of the Adelaide Hills. Grilled peaches and toasted coconut elements lend an exotic edge to this full-bodied wine. Drink it over the next few years.\n35678\tAustralia\t\t92\t25\tVictoria\tBendigo\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBalgownie Estate 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Bendigo)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tBalgownie Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis is classic Cabernet, from the reticent aromas of pencil shavings to the restrained flavors of cassis and cigar box.

Menthol, vanilla, cedar and cassis deliver plenty of flavor in this chunky, full-bodied Cabernet. Charred, mocha-like notes emerge on the long, intense finish.

It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.\n52184\tAustralia\tAmy's\t90\t34\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMoss Wood 2010 Amy's Red (Margaret River)\tRed Blend\tMoss Wood\tGT_90_Points\tCompact and sturdy, this robust blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Merlot is relatively simple, yet satisfying.

There's ample body yet classic Cabernet restraint, so it's not jammy or overdone. The tannins are supple enough to make it enjoyable now, yet sufficient to see it through 2018, at least.\n56439\tAustralia\tDry Red Wine No. 1\t92\t75\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2004 Dry Red Wine No. 1 Red (Yarra Valley)\tCabernet Blend\tYarra Yering\tGT_90_Points\tFolks who enjoy herbal complexities in their Cabernet shouldn't pass this wine up. Aromas of roasted peppers, eucalyptus and cassis verge on vegetal, but the flavors are more refined, layering rich chocolaty notes over cassis and hints of green pepper. It's only medium-bodied, but still packs in plenty of intensity, evidenced on the long, silky finish.

Slightly jammy raspberry fruit is coated in chocolate; even the tannins come across as softly dusty, even vaguely cocoa-like. Drink over the next year or two.\n56458\tAustralia\tCoonawarra Estate Terra Rossa First Growth\t91\t70\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tParker 2004 Coonawarra Estate Terra Rossa First Growth Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Merlot\tParker\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2004 is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Merlot and 100% new French oak. There's plenty of fruit to back up the lavish oak treatment, but this wine needs 3ƒ??5 years to integrate its cassis fruit with the overlay of vanilla, chocolate and toasted coconut. It seems a bit coarsely textured at first, then smoothes out nicely with air, gaining length on the finish. Drink 2008ƒ??2015.\n56832\tAustralia\t\t91\t21\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFox Creek 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFox Creek\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied, creamy and supple, this wine offers textbook aromas of cedar, tobacco and cassis.

Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tJansz\tGT_90_Points\tThis pale salmon ros?? is a reliable sparkling wine at a very good price. The latest NV release is toasty on the nose, then offers just faint hints of peach or berry flavors. It's lithe yet creamy on the palate, with a long finish.\n56953\tAustralia\tGrange\t99\t850\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2010 Grange Shiraz (South Australia)\tShiraz\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tThis inky, embryonic wine deserves to be cellared until at least 2025 and should drink well for at least 25 years after that. It takes its time opening up in the glass to reveal notes of grilled meat, vanilla and plum. In the mouth, it's full bodied and firmly built, with a wall of chewy tannins surrounding a deep ripe core.\n56956\tAustralia\tAndelmonde\t97\t95\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStandish 2012 Andelmonde Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tStandish\tGT_90_Points\tYou may have to scour the country to secure some of this (only 14 cases were imported), but this is a treasure worth the search. It's full bodied without seeming overly rich or heavy, framing the lush notes of dark berries, grilled meat, mint and licorice with supple tannins. Spice-driven flavors linger elegantly on the lengthy finish. It's delicious now, but should age gracefully through 2030.\n56839\tAustralia\t\t91\t28\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYangarra Estate Vineyard 2013 G-S-M (McLaren Vale)\tG-S-M\tYangarra Estate Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied and richly tannic, this gives lie to the notion that all Grenache-based blends are easy quaffers. Dried spices and mixed berries include hints of clove and cracked pepper, finishing with some dry, chewy tannins. The assemblage is 49% Grenache, 29% Shiraz and 22% Mourv??dre. Drink 2020ƒ??2030.\n58956\tAustralia\tThe Wild Pixie\t90\t29\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2009 The Wild Pixie Shiraz-Roussanne (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Roussanne\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tThis is surprisingly tough and tannic for a wine that incorporates 8% of a white variety. But those mouth-drying tannins give shape to the cassis, cranberry and black olive notes. Take a chance by cellaring this rather austere wine for five years or so and see how it develops.\n58841\tAustralia\tPipers River\t91\t35\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDalrymple 2012 Pipers River Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tDalrymple\tGT_90_Points\tThe blended Pinot Noir from Dalrymple equals (or even exceeds) the single-vineyard bottlings on occasion. The 2012 is sturdy yet elegant, with ample weight joined by a silky texture on the long finish. It smells earthy, yet delivers cola, dark cherry and plum flavors.\n58966\tAustralia\t\t90\t20\tWestern Australia\tMount Barker\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2011 Riesling (Mount Barker)\tRiesling\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tThis impressive offering is crystal-clean and direct, with green apple, lime and petrichor notes that typify Riesling. It's medium bodied and fully dry, with a long, lime-riddled finish. Drink it over the next decade or so.\n57729\tAustralia\tMappinga\t91\t25\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSidewood 2015 Mappinga Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tSidewood\tGT_90_Points\tThis silky-textured, medium-bodied wine starts off with aromas of toasted marshmallow and ripe citrus. The flavors show more range, covering hints of melon, white peach, lime, pineapple and roasted cashew, before finishing long and crisp.\n58973\tAustralia\tMenzies The Cigar\t90\t25\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2010 Menzies The Cigar Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a medium-weight, supple Cabernet with bright acids that's seemingly designed for early drinking. Perfumed notes of mint, vanilla, brown sugar and cassis lead the way, followed by similar flavors and ample oak.\n58226\tAustralia\tBlack Label\t90\t70\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWolf Blass 2002 Black Label Red (South Australia)\tRed Blend\tWolf Blass\tGT_90_Points\tThere's nothing to dislike about the 30th anniversary release of this iconic Australian wineƒ??only the price is hard to swallow. Cedar, earth and mint frame the nose, while the dark-fruit and rich cola flavors ease across the palate in a wave of creamy tannins. It even firms up a little on the finish; could age until 2020.\n58205\tAustralia\tCellar No. One Reserve\t91\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChateau Reynella 2004 Cellar No. One Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tChateau Reynella\tGT_90_Points\tLoaded with smoke, hickory and vanilla, this definitely shows plenty of oak, but there's also plenty of fruit to balance the ledger. Cola and blackberry flavors pick up a slightly tart edge on the long, finely textured finish.\n59013\tAustralia\tBaby Bush\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHewitson 2014 Baby Bush Mourv??dre (Barossa Valley)\tMourv??dre\tHewitson\tGT_90_Points\tThe cuttings for this vineyard were taken from the Old Garden Vineyard, so despite it's relatively young age, it has pedigree. Sage, smoke and black olive notes mingle easily on the nose, backed by flavors of vanilla, black cherry and mocha. It's medium to full in body and creamy in texture, with a smooth, silky finish.\n60278\tAustralia\tSingle Vineyard\t90\t27\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWise 2005 Single Vineyard Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tWise\tGT_90_Points\tFans of structured Chard should give this a try. Ripe citrus flavors are subtly framed by toasty oak in a medium-bodied wine that finishes crisp and minerally. Good now, but should last through 2010.\n59977\tAustralia\tThe Peake\t96\t150\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHickinbotham 2013 The Peake Cabernet-Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet-Shiraz\tHickinbotham\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023ƒ??2035, and posssibly beyond.\n62372\tAustralia\tHarry & Edward's Garden\t90\t60\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTwo Hands 2006 Harry & Edward's Garden Shiraz (Langhorne Creek)\tShiraz\tTwo Hands\tGT_90_Points\tLike all of the 2006 Garden offerings from Two Hands, this one is full-bodied, creamy and makes a slightly sweet impression on the palate because of its combination of high alcohol (15.2%) and superripe fruit. Cedary, spicy oak accents raspberry and cassis flavors, which persist on the long finish. Drink nowƒ??2011.\n59893\tAustralia\tVMR\t90\t18\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tThe Black Chook 2006 VMR White (South Australia)\tWhite Blend\tThe Black Chook\tGT_90_Points\tVMR stands for Viognier, Marsanne and Roussanne, which are blended together in this flamboyantly floral version of a Rh??ne-style white.

Notes of toasted hazelnuts and grilled tropical fruit mingle into an opulent parfait of flavor that's held together by bright acidity, while a lingering veil of smoke hangs on the finish.\n59821\tAustralia\tTiers Vineyard\t93\t70\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTapaNappa 2006 Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tTapaNappa\tGT_90_Points\tBrian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way. This is a plump, amply textured wine that doesn't lack for elegance, marrying scents and flavors of toasted grain with white peaches and hazelnuts. Long and intense on the finish, echoing with toasty oak but also layers of vibrant fruit.

Some gently toasted nut notes impart richness of texture and complexity on the palate. Long and slightly tannic on the finish, this could develop well over the next 2ƒ??3 years.\n59962\tAustralia\tAvignon\t90\t35\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKaesler 2009 Avignon Red (Barossa Valley)\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tKaesler\tGT_90_Points\tThis blend of 54% Grenache, 28% Shiraz and 18% Mourv??dre often offers solid value. The 2009 features hints of mocha, vanilla and red plum on the nose, accented by a pinch of peppery cinnamon. In the mouth, it's medium to full in body and richly textured without being over the top, then ends on a warming spice note. Drink now and over the next few years.\n59453\tAustralia\t\t90\t62\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\t\t\tOccam's Razor 2014 Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tOccam's Razor\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a herbaceous expression of Shiraz from the under appreciated Heathcote region of Victoria, and made by Emily Laughton, daughter of the well-regarded Jasper Hill family. Mint and green herbs mingle with potpourri, juicy fruit, and charred oak characters. Tannins are tightly wound at the moment, but the wine is well balanced and here for the long haul. Drink 2020ƒ??2032.\n59455\tAustralia\tThe Experiment Estate Single Vineyard\t90\t36\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tPenny's Hill 2015 The Experiment Estate Single Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tPenny's Hill\tGT_90_Points\tA red cherry aroma is interwoven with violets and dried herbs.

(Barossa Valley)\tRos??\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough not indicated on the label, this is 100% Mourv??dre, bone dry and barrel fermented. As a result, it's not your typical fresh and fruity ros??, showing instead dark, complex flavors of cola, chocolate tree bark and earth. Hints of strawberry lighten it somewhat, but this is almost more red than ros??.

Juicy, mouthwatering cassis fruit is framed by cedar, vanilla and baking spices, while the finish showcases fine tannins.

The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring. Drink 2018ƒ??2030.\n61643\tAustralia\tGold Label\t91\t25\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWolf Blass 2008 Gold Label Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tWolf Blass\tGT_90_Points\tAn excellent value, the 2008 Gold Label Shiraz is a full-bodied, powerfully built wine, filled out by cassis, chocolate and tobacco flavors.

The 2008 is pure and ripe, with great black-cherry and cassis flavors, framed by an elegant vanilla-oak note. It's full bodied and plushly textured without being unstructured, and it should drink well over the next 15 years.\n64166\tAustralia\tWarboys Vineyard\t92\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAngove 2013 Warboys Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tAngove\tGT_90_Points\tSmoky, savory and plummy, this wine boasts ample weight and a plush, creamy texture.

Baking spices and plummy fruit form a concentrated, nearly impenetrable wall on the nose, while the palate is nearly dense enough to stand a fork in. Despite all that, it's not overly heavy or fudge-like, instead offering tremendous poise, purity and length. Drink 2020ƒ??2030, and likely then some.\n84926\tAustralia\tAngels Share\t90\t35\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTwo Hands 2007 Angels Share Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tTwo Hands\tGT_90_Points\tPlums, vanilla, toasty oak and a bit of chocolate fudge.

Vaguely minty, herbal notes make a brief appearance, then give way to raspberry and blueberry fruit. Savory  hints creep in on the palate, further increasing its appeal. This blend of fruit from the Barossa and Eden valleys should drink well through at least 2020.\n87623\tAustralia\tWarner Vineyard\t94\t100\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiaconda 2008 Warner Vineyard Shiraz (Victoria)\tShiraz\tGiaconda\tGT_90_Points\tWith only 10 cases imported to the U.S., one suspects that this terrific wine will largely be found in exclusive restaurants. If you can find a bottle at a reasonable markup, jump on it, for this is one of Victoria's finest Shirazes. Hickory smoke, espresso and herbal notes accent raspberry fruit, whose brightness gives the wine extra lift and dimension. It's creamy and lushly textured without ever seeming heavy, and boasts a long, silky finish that echoes with suggestions of cocoa powder and pulverized coffee beans.

Drink 2015-2025.\n86243\tAustralia\tYattarna\t91\t66\tSouth Australia\tHenty\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2004 Yattarna Chardonnay (Henty)\tChardonnay\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tDespite being a 2004 vintage wine, this top-shelf Chardonnay from Penfolds is still embryonic in its development, shrouded in some smoky, tarry, coffee-like aromas that call for brisk decanting. Underneath, you'll find richly textured layers of ripe, honeyed fruit and grilled peaches, ending with lingering notes of citrus. Drink nowƒ??2015.\n85859\tAustralia\t\t90\t32\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHentley Farm 2007 Zinfandel (Barossa Valley)\tZinfandel\tHentley Farm\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine handles its elevated alcohol level (labeled at 16.5%) well, with masses of slightly jammy fruit and a creamy, lush mouthfeel. Hints of baking spices and leather add complexity and persist through the long finish. It'd be fun to throw this in a blind tasting with some of California's top Zins.\n86779\tAustralia\tDeluxe Vintage Brut\t92\t80\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tApogee 2012 Deluxe Vintage Brut Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tApogee\tGT_90_Points\tOne of Tasmania's most notable wine personalities, Andrew Pirie, is behind this wine, which aims to compete with prestige cuv??e Champagnes. Forty percent of the base wine is barrel-fermented, imparting a rich, cashew character that's augmented by two years of aging on lees. It's a complex, medium-bodied wine that's a departure from most New World sparklers.\n89453\tAustralia\tThe Laughing Magpie\t90\t29\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Laughing Magpie Shiraz-Viognier (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Viognier\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tStarts off dark and a bit brooding, with aromas of plum, espresso and black olive, but shows hints of brighter fruit elements on the palate. Mouthfilling but dry on the finish, this is still very young; decant if serving now, or try 2013-2020.\n85802\tAustralia\tHillside Amery Vineyard\t93\t60\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKay Brothers 2010 Hillside Amery Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKay Brothers\tGT_90_Points\tA McLaren Vale standard bearer, the 2010 Hillside is a complex, beguiling example of Shiraz. Toast and vanilla notes frame hints of raspberries, herbs and espresso on the nose, while the flavors add olive-tinged elements. Despite showing ample weight, this isn't the biggest wine, just one that shows impressive harmony and length. Drink now through at least 2025.\n89184\tAustralia\tWarboys Vineyard\t92\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAngove 2013 Warboys Vineyard Shiraz-Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz-Grenache\tAngove\tGT_90_Points\tThis is 68% Shiraz, 32% Grenache. Compared to the straight Shiraz, this is spicier, showing more leather, clove and pepper. It's still a full-bodied, rich wine, but maybe a bit less plush, with brighter acids.\n86952\tAustralia\tDry Red Wine No. 1\t90\t85\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2005 Dry Red Wine No. 1 Red (Yarra Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tYarra Yering\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a little slow out of the gate, starting off with some rather cabbage-like aromas. Over time, the odors evolve toward smoke and ash, and, finally, into a complex, cedary aroma. The flavors of this medium-bodied blend (80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec, 8% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot) feature blackberry and cassis, but also fold in hints of smoked meat and vanilla before finishing crisp and long. This really evolves and improves in the glass, suggesting 10-plus years of potential longevity.\n90485\tAustralia\tSt. Andrews Single Vineyard Release\t93\t60\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2010 St. Andrews Single Vineyard Release Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tDried herb and tobacco accent a mix of red and black fruit in this silky-textured wine.

This one clocks in at 15.7%, but doesn't seem hot or heavy, just mouthfilling and round. Blueberry and blackberry fruit lead the way, but they're joined by earthier notes of black olive, coffee and tree bark.

This shows aromatic red currants, bay leaf and sage on the nose, then folds in hints of cinnamon and brown sugar. The oak is in the background, letting the fruit carry the wine, yet building in a rich, velvety texture.

The 2008 displays slightly vegetal shadings of capsicum and tomato that may prove controversial, but there's ample cassis as well, rounded out by a cedar note. Its medium weight and delicate, silky texture combine to impart those ineffable qualities of grace and elegance.\n93260\tAustralia\tThe Ironstone Pressings\t92\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2006 The Ironstone Pressings G-S-M (McLaren Vale)\tG-S-M\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tFor a Grenache-dominated (70%) blend, this shows outstanding structure. the firm tannins are slightly drying right now, but should smooth out nicely by 2012 and the wine should continue to drink well through at least 2020.

Cedary, gently sawdusty notes and a touch of nail polish are apparent on the nose, while the palate is admirably full bodied and richly textured. The finish is generally velvety, but also shows hints of varnish or paint thinner. Overall, the raw materials are impressive, but the wine comes across as a bit disjointed.\n75206\tAustralia\tMuseum Release\t87\t25\tVictoria\tNagambie Lakes\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTahbilk 2007 Museum Release Marsanne (Nagambie Lakes)\tMarsanne\tTahbilk\tLT_90_Points\tA curiosity that's definitely worth trying, as aged Marsanne from anywhere other than Hermitage is a rarity.

Perhaps because such miniscule quantities are available (30 cases of the 2005 Quintet).

It's a little stingy on the midpalate, but there are plenty of other things to make up for it.

It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango pur??e, ripe and succulent and honeyed.

It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H.

The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar.

It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.\n6729\tUS\tJoy!

Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak.

The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits.

You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10ƒ??20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.\n6285\tUS\tOlivet Lane Vineyard\t94\t55\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tWilliams Selyem 2011 Olivet Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)\tChardonnay\tWilliams Selyem\tGT_90_Points\tInsanely rich and opulent, brimming with apricot and tangerine jam, green-apple butter, pineapple tart, vanilla, honeysuckle, buttered toast and spice flavors.

It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute.

It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.\n7171\tUS\tGarys' Vineyard\t90\t32\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\t\t\tNovy 2011 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tSyrah\tNovy\tGT_90_Points\tSome wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020.\n7175\tUS\tDry\t90\t16\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C.

The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.\n7862\tUS\t\t94\t60\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tMount Eden Vineyards 2012 Chardonnay (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tChardonnay\tMount Eden Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tSeared yellow grapefruit, white flowers and a hint of almonds make for a fresh but simultaneously nutty nose on this classic bottling from the historic producer, whose grapes come from the top of the high-elevation appellation.

However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, cr??me de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar.

Yet, it's there in the form of buttered toast. The result is a big, powerful Chardonnay, clean and vibrant, for drinking now with dramatic shellfish and pork dishes.\n7563\tUS\tDomaine\t90\t60\tOregon\tOregon\tOregon Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tKing Estate 2008 Domaine Pinot Noir (Oregon)\tPinot Noir\tKing Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThe wine is King Estate's superpremium offering, made exclusively with organically grown grapes from the estate vineyard. Lush and earthy, it's got a lot of forward, tart berry fruit power, turns a bit soft in the middle, and sails away with a hint of heat and a lick of chocolate.\n6578\tUS\tReserve\t94\t75\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tSheridan Vineyard 2005 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSheridan Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tMore powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptionalƒ??dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way.

It blends together ripe raspberry, creamy vanilla and red cherry on a smooth, nicely viscous and very full-bodied frame that helps the finish linger.\n5656\tUS\t\t90\t24\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tBroken Earth 2015 Verdelho (Paso Robles)\tVerdelho\tBroken Earth\tGT_90_Points\tThere is tons of potential for this varietal in the hot eastern reaches of Paso Robles. Light peach and Pink Lady apple aromas start off the easy-to-enjoy nose. The palate shows more layers, starting with ripe peach and then firming up on citrus pith, sour apple and tangy pear. A gravelly minerality and rising texture on the finish complete the picture.\n5660\tUS\t\t90\t28\tCalifornia\tTemecula Valley\tSouth Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tCougar 2015 Falanghina (Temecula Valley)\tFalanghina\tCougar\tGT_90_Points\tFinding new varietals is always fun, and this take on an ancient grape from Campania, Italy, offers promise in warm Temecula. Crisp Anjou and Asian pears show on the nose, along with salt, Gala apple, white flowers and gravel.

Both come from Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes, but in 2012 the wine has more floral highlights, and a vertical crispness to its structure. Flavors of anise, green apple and pear are wound up in the tight frame, and this would appear to have some years of life ahead.\n5698\tUS\tEstate\t91\t27\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tGamache 2011 Estate Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))\tCabernet Franc\tGamache\tGT_90_Points\tThe finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check.\n6580\tUS\tOld Vines Dedication Series #26\t94\t84\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tWoodward Canyon 2006 Old Vines Dedication Series #26 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWoodward Canyon\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.\n6584\tUS\tTrenton Station Vineyard\t93\t38\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tLost Canyon 2007 Trenton Station Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)\tSyrah\tLost Canyon\tGT_90_Points\tThis bottling from Lost Canyon is one of California's best-kept Syrah secrets. Year after year, it's a rich, tannic, dramatically structured wine of impressive depth and deliciousness. Packed with dry berry, cherry, leather, mocha and toasty oak flavors, it's beautiful now, with decanting, and should hold and even improve for up to six years.\n6587\tUS\t\t93\t75\tCalifornia\tHowell Mountain\tNapa\t\t\tRoberts & Rogers 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRoberts & Rogers\tGT_90_Points\tHere's one for the cellar.

Altogether, they form soft, spicy waves of full-bodied flavor, showing off characteristics of leather, black pepper and clove, with the tannins intrusive and lengthy.\n4132\tUS\t\t90\t30\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tWesterly 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Ynez Valley)\tChardonnay\tWesterly\tGT_90_Points\tFor an appellation blend, this is a nicely complex bottling. The nose offers toasted almonds, lemon twist, lime pith, browned butter, light pineapple and the slightest touch of dairy. The sip starts off slightly sour, framed with sizzling acidity and a savory salty character, conveying flavors of lime peels, wet slate and just enough melted butter on the finish.\n4380\tUS\tTradition\t91\t30\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tGordon Brothers 2004 Tradition Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tGordon Brothers\tGT_90_Points\tPerhaps the last Washington wine of the vintage to be released, this is beginning to enter mid-life. For those who want a hint of how well Washington reds can age, this is a perfect introduction. Drinking beautifully at the moment, though definitely ageworthy still, it shows a soft mix of medium-ripe red fruits, chocolate, herb, earth and barrel. The finish is like soft leather, with a final impression of milk chocolate. Very seductive.\n4974\tUS\tPure\t90\t34\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTolosa 2011 Pure Chardonnay (Edna Valley)\tChardonnay\tTolosa\tGT_90_Points\tTolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits.\n4482\tUS\tCanoe Ridge Estate\t91\t28\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

Combining the ripe fruit of warm climates with the acidity of cool regions, the wine has black currant, beef jerky, sour cherry candy, black pepper, anise and cola flavors that are quite complex. Not likely to age, but a lovely, full-bodied red to have now.\n2303\tUS\tConner Lee Vineyard\t90\t18\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tArbor Crest 2006 Conner Lee Vineyard Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA))\tChardonnay\tArbor Crest\tGT_90_Points\tThis big, buttery Chardonnay will especially appeal to those who like California-style flavors; here enhanced with the firm acids characteristic of Washington State.

Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.\n2456\tUS\tSignature\t90\t38\tCalifornia\tMendocino\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tAlder Springs 2013 Signature Chardonnay (Mendocino)\tChardonnay\tAlder Springs\tGT_90_Points\tLike a lemon-cream pastry in a bottle, this low-yield, hillside-grown wine has buttery, creamy aromas, rich almond and bright lemon flavors and a soft, nearly sweet finish. Not too full-bodied, it's a bit lighter in texture than many, because of that fresh lemony acidity to buoy it up.\n5668\tUS\tThe Fum??\t90\t14\tCalifornia\tNorth Coast\tNorth Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tMurphy-Goode 2015 The Fum??

The rest is a mix of Merlot, Cab Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, melded into a deep and satisfying whole. Beautifully mixed cassis, berry and cherry fruits are dotted with dried herb.

The blue and purple fruit notes and dusty tannins all say California, but the laser-like definition, minerality and natural acidity prove it's Washington fruit all the way.

So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.\n5728\tUS\tSpecial Reserve\t90\t42\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tHerzog 2012 Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHerzog\tGT_90_Points\tPlum clafouti and a marriage of cherry and clove provide a foundation above which lies a spicy mix of dried herb and cedar in this integrated, softly approachable wine of medium-build and length.\n5729\tUS\tQ\t90\t85\tCalifornia\tGreen Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tIron Horse 2013 Q Pinot Noir (Green Valley)\tPinot Noir\tIron Horse\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a replanted single vineyard, single clone site, the first vintage since that replanting in 2009, there's a youthful awkwardness still at play here, though the wine is quite juicy in black cherry and a lingering suggestion of soy. The oak and tannin are fairly firm and pronounced.\n5771\tUS\tDerbyshire Vineyard\t92\t34\tCalifornia\tSan Luis Obispo County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLast Light 2013 Derbyshire Vineyard Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County)\tPinot Noir\tLast Light\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine from an extreme coastal vineyard is framed by earthy notes of turned black loam as well as a cherry blossom ripeness, with a laid-back sagebrush element and touch of olive. There's a lot of thyme and marjoram on the palate, as well as orange rinds, plum peel, barely ripe cranberry fruit and a graphite tension.\n2085\tUS\tEl Portal\t90\t24\tCalifornia\tCalaveras County\tSierra Foothills\t\t\tNewsome-Harlow 2007 El Portal Petite Sirah (Calaveras County)\tPetite Sirah\tNewsome-Harlow\tGT_90_Points\tIt's hard to make Petite Sirah smooth and elegant, but Newsome-Harlow has done it. The wine shows classically fine tannins, while the flavors run toward milk chocolate, ripe blackberries and lots of crushed black pepper. Delicious and refined, a great wine for peppersteak.\n2087\tUS\t\t90\t22\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tPeju 2008 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tPeju\tGT_90_Points\tThis is Peju's best Sauvignon Blanc in many years. It's bone dry and elegantly crisp in acidity, a clean, vibrant, food-friendly wine. With just a hint of oak, it shows rich flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, with exotic notes of papaya and white flowers. What a great comeback.\n3653\tUS\t\t93\t40\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tForefathers 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tForefathers\tGT_90_Points\tThis is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.\n3655\tUS\tEstate\t92\t40\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tBridlewood 2004 Estate Syrah (Santa Ynez Valley)\tSyrah\tBridlewood\tGT_90_Points\tBridlewood has crafted a very serious Syrah, from a region of Santa Barbara County that excels at this Rh??ne variety. The wine is fully dry and full-bodied, with rich, dense tannins, but what's notable is the depth of flavor. The blackberries, currants, licorice, cola, mocha and smoky oak flavors are very rich.

It's substantial but not tiring; the balance of fruit, acid and tannins holds it together through a spicy, lingering finish. It's just a delicious wine, and one that should cellar well also.\n3660\tUS\t\t92\t60\tCalifornia\tSt. Helena\tNapa\t\t\tParry Cellars 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tParry Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tShows a fine, polished Napa style in the perfectly ripe blackberry and currant flavors, and in the way the sweet and ultrarefined tannins give the wine such classic structure.

It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.\n1317\tUS\tEstate\t90\t42\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tViszlay Vineyards 2013 Estate Petite Sirah (Russian River Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tViszlay Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tA bright, floral fragrance invites one to further explore this softly structured wine.

Cocoa nibs, coffee, black cherry, dill, bay leaf and black olive pop on the palate, where the lingering acidity ensures aging potential.\n5571\tUS\tWholer Vineyard\t90\t35\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tLongboard 2007 Wholer Vineyard Pinotage (Russian River Valley)\tPinotage\tLongboard\tGT_90_Points\tSoft and unctuous, this wine has sweet flavors of ripe fruits, glycerine and new oak, balanced with crisp acidity. Pinotage is the South African cross between Pinot Noir and Cinsault, and the wine has a silky texture and luscious flavors of cherries, red currants, vanilla and pepper spice.

There is a hint of gun metal running through the palate, and as the wine warms and slowly opens, it reveals a lingering finish with a little pat of butter left on the tongue. This should be in fine shape for at least another decade.\n1067\tUS\t\t94\t34\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSea Slopes 2015 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tSea Slopes\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola.

It shows more oak-derived flavors, along with ripe plum and cherry fruit. Streaks of espresso, vanilla and chocolate come through, suggesting it will only improve with a hearty decant or additional bottle age. Drink now through the mid-2020s.\n531\tUS\tBlanc de Noir\t91\t50\tOregon\tOregon\tOregon Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tLe Cadeau 2011 Blanc de Noir Sparkling (Oregon)\tSparkling Blend\tLe Cadeau\tGT_90_Points\tOne of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.\n533\tUS\t??quinoxe\t91\t50\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tLe Cadeau 2015 ??quinoxe Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tLe Cadeau\tGT_90_Points\tSlightly liquorous when first opened, this pushes the alcohol up towards a place where some of the nuances are lost. But it has plenty of flavor, power and punch. Black coffee, black cherry, black olive and black licorice are entwined here, with some heat in the follow-through. Give it a good decanting and it will start to smooth out.\n669\tUS\tMcClellan Estate Vineyard\t90\t30\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

It's softly tannic, with pronounced jolts of tobacco and black pepper. With small amounts of other Rh??ne varieties, from Syrah to Viognier, it meanders to the finish, with a distinct trace of minerality.\n672\tUS\tDry\t90\t26\tNew York\tLong Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C.

Smaller amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add cherries and violets, while oak contributes smoky complexities. Rich and elegant, the wine provides lovely drinking now.\n1470\tUS\tHollister Edna Ranch\t93\t100\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tTolosa 2015 Hollister Edna Ranch Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)\tPinot Noir\tTolosa\tGT_90_Points\tExtremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.\n1472\tUS\tSievers Reserve\t93\t80\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tVolker Eisele Family Estate 2013 Sievers Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVolker Eisele Family Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis varietal Cabernet Sauvignon hails from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate.

Released almost a full year later than the other Long Shadows reds, it is well-integrated and focused, with high-toned black cherry fruit set in dusty tannins. Scents of sandalwood drift through, along with cocoa and spice. As good or even better than the outstanding 2006.\n1883\tUS\tHyde Vineyard\t93\t55\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tPatz & Hall 2009 Hyde Vineyard Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tPatz & Hall\tGT_90_Points\tThe reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity.\n1502\tUS\tBaranoff Vineyard\t92\t71\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tSmall Vines 2010 Baranoff Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tSmall Vines\tGT_90_Points\tReally easy to like now for its silky approachability, and for the way the flavors gather upfront and through the long, spicy finish.

Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious. After all that, it possesses an indefinable attribute of fascination. Will age well for a long time, if you can keep your hands off it.

What keeps it focused and precise are the vivid acids and sculpted tannins. It's the work of a young winemaker who is improving dramatically with each new vintage, even as his vineyard puts out better and better fruit.\n3077\tUS\t\t94\t125\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tLineage 2007 Red (Livermore Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tLineage\tGT_90_Points\tThough it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend).

It's fabulously rich in raspberry cream, blackberry jam, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Very flamboyant and delicious, but really more of a dessert wine than a dry table wine.\n3866\tUS\tUnderwood Mountain Vineyards 55% Riesling/45% Gewurztraminer Ice Wine\t91\t60\tOregon\tColumbia Gorge (OR)\tOregon Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tViento 2009 Underwood Mountain Vineyards 55% Riesling/45% Gewurztraminer Ice Wine Gew?¬rztraminer-Riesling (Columbia Gorge (OR))\tGew?¬rztraminer-Riesling\tViento\tGT_90_Points\tA field blend ice wineƒ??don't see that very oftenƒ??it's full-bodied, almost lush, and packed with mixed slightly candied fruitsƒ??tropical, stone fruits and citrus.

It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.\n550\tUS\tEstate Reserve\t93\t35\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tArtesa 2014 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Carneros)\tChardonnay\tArtesa\tGT_90_Points\tThe estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder.

It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ƒ??05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.\n1868\tUS\tPalengat Red Wine\t93\t85\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?ÿ\tQuilceda Creek 2008 Palengat Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills)\tRed Blend\tQuilceda Creek\tGT_90_Points\tQuilceda's single-vineyard Bordeaux-style blend is 76% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Cabernet Franc, 7% Merlot and 3% Petit Verdot, from a vineyard just across the road from Champoux. Dusty and fragrant, it suggests soft leather, toast, caramel and coconut, hiding its fruit at first in a wash of luxurious barrel flavors. That fruit emerges with some hours of decanting, a tart and racy mix of berry and sweet tomato.\n1455\tUS\tIngenuity\t94\t70\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tEpoch Estate Wines 2013 Ingenuity Red (Paso Robles)\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tEpoch Estate Wines\tGT_90_Points\tThe winery's characteristic dense style is immediately apparent in this blend of 54% Syrah, 21% Mourv??dre, 16% Grenache and 9% Petite Sirah.

Full bodied and luxurious on the palate, a lithe jolt of acidity rears its head just before the finish, trying to compete with the licorice and leather. Drink now through 2020.\n555\tUS\t\t93\t75\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

The wine is refreshing, dry and nicely braced with acidity, but at the same time rather broad and soothing in texture. In other words, beautifully balanced and wonderfully complex.\n3976\tUS\tColson Canyon Vineyard\t90\t36\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\t\t\tMargerum 2007 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County)\tSyrah\tMargerum\tGT_90_Points\tIf more Syrah tasted like this, more people would drink it.

The result is aromas of Asian pear, white peach, baked apple and baking spice, more fresh rather than sweet. It is viscous on the sip, and the sweetness steadily grows on the palate, offering cotton candy flavors.

Tobacco, tomato leaf, root beer and bouillon flavors set up an herbal, almost Bordeaux-like finish. Layered and structured to boot. Drink now through 2012.\n61610\tSpain\t\t90\t24\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbad Dom Bueno 2011 Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tAbad Dom Bueno\tGT_90_Points\tConcentrated, potent aromas of earthy blackberry and cassis bring notes of briar patch, prune and exotic spices. The palate is full and oaky but fresh, with flavors of berry, cassis, herb and wood grain. A heavy finish with overt oak and related spice is modern in style.

The nose offers up tobacco, moss and soft berry aromas. In the mouth, it's intense, deep and still tannic, with baked, earthy flavors of blackberry, plum, tobacco and coconut. The finish is stuffed with chocolate, herb, spice and cola flavors along with undeniable density. An excellent wine to drink now through 2020.\n61615\tSpain\tRoble\t90\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEncanto 2011 Roble Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tEncanto\tGT_90_Points\tThis fresh, pure value red cranks out raspberry and boysenberry aromas in front of a crisp, tight palate.

This is racy on the palate, with a fairly full body. Vanilla and caramel flavors turn darker and toastier with airing, while the fruit on this older Rioja favors cherry and currant. Cocoa, tobacco notes with a juicy length define the finish. Drink through 2024.\n66469\tSpain\tEl Albar Lurton Barricas\t90\t25\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFran??ois Lurton 2008 El Albar Lurton Barricas Tinta de Toro (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tTinta de Toro\tFran??ois Lurton\tGT_90_Points\tImpressive for a 2008 Tempranillo.

The palate is big and concentrated, with fine balance for such a modern, full-fruited wine. Flavors of ripe blackberry, toast, coffee, chocolate and spice cover the spectrum of what you want from a crowd pleaser such as this.\n63625\tSpain\tValdegines Single Vineyard\t93\t65\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2010 Valdegines Single Vineyard  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tArtadi\tGT_90_Points\tThis is one minerally wine for Rioja. Stony scents blend with latex and Band-Aid, while lemon peel and hard-driving berry aromas define the nose. Monster tannins are absorbed by the wine's broad foundation, while flavors of smoke, oak, plum and wild berry finish savory and long, with a final shot of oak-based clove. Best from 2018ƒ??2025.\n65809\tSpain\tCata de Consejero\t92\t48\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConsejo de la Alta 2011 Cata de Consejero  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tConsejo de la Alta\tGT_90_Points\tBlackberry, black currant and toasty oak make for a dark, charred, manly nose.

Concentrated and huge on the palate, but with enviable balance, this powerful, ripe Garnacha deals blackberry and dark-plum flavors prior to an oaky, spicy, chocolaty finish with peppery, blackened spice notes. This is a monster wine with 16.5% abv, but it can handle it.\n64104\tSpain\tRioja Bord??n Gran Reserva\t91\t24\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas 2006 Rioja Bord??n Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas\tGT_90_Points\tRipe, easy aromas of dried cherry, raisin and cedary spice are not unfamiliar for aged, traditional Rioja like this. The palate is fresh in feel, with a touch of oak resin impacting the mouthfeel. Common flavors of cherry, plum and spice finish with cocoa, dill, vanilla and tomato notes. This is a classic Gran Reserva to drink through 2024.\n64105\tSpain\tLeonor Palo Cortado 12 A?ños\t91\t26\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGonz?­lez Byass NV Leonor Palo Cortado 12 A?ños Palomino (Jerez)\tPalomino\tGonz?­lez Byass\tGT_90_Points\tPungent and pure up front, this 12-year-old Palo Cortado smells nutty and like toffee, with notes of orange peel and apricot. The palate reflects the bouquet, meaning it's clean and exact, with buttery flavors of dried nuts and not too much salt. This runs smooth on the finish and would be ideal in a savory soup or with saut??ed mushrooms.\n66231\tSpain\tValdegines\t91\t65\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArtadi 2012 Valdegines  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tArtadi\tGT_90_Points\tHailing from a hot, dry year, this single-vineyard Rioja smells grapy and like cassis and fresh herbs. In the mouth, it's loud on the attack but doesn't sport the structure of previous vintages. Short black-fruit flavors pick up complexity and depth with airing, but a quiet, jammy finish confirms that this is up to par but not one of Artadi's standout wines. Drink through 2022.\n69010\tSpain\t\t91\t95\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2007 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine pushes the envelope on concentration and ripeness. It's full of prune, raisin and licorice on the nose, but also a lot of weight. It's quite jammy and soft by Priorat standards, as intense blackberry and molten fudge flavors take over. Chewy, warm and ready to drink.\n68299\tSpain\tArdal Gran Reserva Selecci??n Especial\t91\t80\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBalbas 2009 Ardal Gran Reserva Selecci??n Especial  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tBalbas\tGT_90_Points\tBaked raisiny aromas of spice cake are almost overdone. Like many 2009 RDDs, this is huge, tannic and massive as a whole. A woody flavor profile includes earthy jammy berry fruit, while this is heavy with campfire notes on the finish. This is 80% Tempranillo and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink through 2023.\n68532\tSpain\tDemencia\t91\t65\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDemencia de Autor 2008 Demencia Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tDemencia de Autor\tGT_90_Points\tDark, compact and black, with graphite and growling blackberry aromas.

It's light and smoky smelling, with brown sugar, fine cologne and cedary aromas. Generous but well-cut in the mouth, with fig, mushroom, raspberry and spiced plum flavors. Fresh on the finish, with light herb flavors and good weight. Drink now through 2018.\n70675\tSpain\tEl Rinc??n Estate Bottled\t90\t30\tCentral Spain\tVinos de Madrid\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Gri?ñon 2008 El Rinc??n Estate Bottled Syrah-Grenache (Vinos de Madrid)\tSyrah-Grenache\tMarques de Gri?ñon\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of dried spices, earth, cola and obligatory black fruits open this Syrah-Garnacha blend. The palate features grabby tannins and flavors of blackberry, herbs and leather. On the finish, a licorice flavor pops up and blends into earthy notes supported by muscular tannins.

Orange, mango and a touch of brown sugar fill out the flavor profile, while a smooth finish avoids stickiness by offering up bracing acidity.\n70543\tSpain\tBarranc dels Closos\t91\t25\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas Igneus 2009 Barranc dels Closos Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMas Igneus\tGT_90_Points\tThis is deep and fruity up front, with blackberry and cola aromas that come with creamy oak and offsetting minerality. Full and jammy on the palate, with flavors of blackberry, fine herbs and lightly applied molasses. Round and concentrated on the finish. Drink now through 2016.\n73169\tSpain\tLuis Peique\t93\t100\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPeique 2009 Luis Peique Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tPeique\tGT_90_Points\tThe pride of Peique, this warm-vintage Bierzo is power-charged on the nose, with smoky, woody aromas of baked berry fruits. Layered, intense, chewy and integrated on the palate, this Menc??a tastes like licorice and baking spices blended with black cherry and plum. The finish is dark and full, but lively.

On the palate, bulky, grabby tannins are rugged and provide structure to an otherwise very ripe wine. Flavors of coconut, mocha, plum and black currant give this a Mounds bar character. Drink through 2022.\n74860\tSpain\t\t90\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJos?? Pariente 2009 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tJos??

High acidity tethered to a medium body creates some midpalate emptiness, while plum, currant and berry flavors are fresh on a pointy finish. Drink through 2024.\n72220\tSpain\tM2 de Matallana\t91\t48\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2005 M2 de Matallana  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tGT_90_Points\tBig and dark, with cola, forest floor and other dark, secure aromas. The palate is young and burly, with ripe blackberry, cola and coffee flavors. As you'd expect, it's a bit more narrow than Matallana's top wine, but it's still round, long and not difficult to like. Classic modern RDD; dark and sultry. Drink now through 2011.\n72097\tSpain\tCasa Conde de Haro Metodo Tradicional Brut\t91\t26\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2013 Casa Conde de Haro Metodo Tradicional Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMuga\tGT_90_Points\tBrioche and buttered bread aromas lead the way on the nose.

Additional aromas of vanilla wafer, acacia, honeydew and minerals lead to a clean-flowing palate. Minerally peach and nectarine flavors show a touch of almond-skin bitterness on the finish.\n74744\tSpain\tEl Molar\t90\t19\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Castillo 2015 El Molar Garnacha (Jumilla)\tGarnacha\tCasa Castillo\tGT_90_Points\tEarly aromas of latex and animal hide yield to earthy berry scents. A lively palate is full of energy, while blackberry, baked plum and chocolate flavors are more dense and generous than streamlined. Flavors of fudge, fig and berry fruits are bold on the finish. Drink through 2021.\n71601\tSpain\tAureum Gran Reserva\t90\t51\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMont Mar??al 2008 Aureum Gran Reserva Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMont Mar??al\tGT_90_Points\tThis vintage no-dosage Cava is naturally smoky smelling and crisp as a whistle, with apple aromas.

The finish is pure, and as you'd expect from a top-notch brut nature, minerally and elegant.\n71611\tSpain\tGago\t90\t31\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2009 Gago  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tGT_90_Points\tEarthy aromas of clay accent core blackberry and cassis scents. Hailing from a warm year, it's not surprising that this feels lush and padded. Flavors of chunky blackberry, stewed plum and chocolate finish creamy, earthy and a touch flat. Drink this meaty, round, soft-bodied Toro now through 2016.\n73690\tSpain\tRoyal Esmeralda Fine Dry Amontillado\t91\t25\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSandeman NV Royal Esmeralda Fine Dry Amontillado Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tSandeman\tGT_90_Points\tQuite the classic, with rich toffee and nut-like aromas that come through with piercing power. The briny palate is all about dried citrus and nuts, while the earthy, long finish has an unmistakable and very nice mushroom quality. This is a precise, somewhat reserved and dainty amontillado, but it's structured and quite real as far as style and impact.\n72268\tSpain\tFinca Calvestra\t91\t35\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMustiguillo 2013 Finca Calvestra Meseguera (Spain)\tMeseguera\tMustiguillo\tGT_90_Points\tGiven that this is Merseguera, a variety that normally doesn't rank that high, this is impressive. Aromas of honey, peach, apple and melon are more composed than loud, while the palate is layered and braced by fresh acidity. Flavors of apple and green plum are lightly oaked, while the finish is lemony and long.\n71738\tSpain\tEl Albar Lurton Excelencia\t93\t55\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFran??ois Lurton 2008 El Albar Lurton Excelencia Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tTempranillo\tFran??ois Lurton\tGT_90_Points\tAn excellent effort given that 2008 was by no means an excellent vintage. This Tempranillo is loaded with alluring aromas of sous-bois, marzipan, cola, moss and black-fruit aromas. The feel is thorough and pure, with blackberry, black licorice, graphite and chocolate flavors. It's textured and deep, but not overly tannic or hard on the finish. Drink now through 2015.\n71775\tSpain\tCrianza\t90\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBracamonte 2011 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBracamonte\tGT_90_Points\tGritty aromas of road tar share space on the nose with black cherry and dark plum scents.

This edition smells reedy and spicy, but also like ripe plum and raisin. A generous balanced palate holds flavors of vanilla, plum, cherry and peppery spice. On the finish, this is composed in feel, dry and spicy. Drink through 2019.\n76281\tSpain\tOloroso Single Vintage Single Vineyard\t92\t155\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Hidalgo 1986 Oloroso Single Vintage Single Vineyard Sherry (Jerez)\tSherry\tBodegas Hidalgo\tGT_90_Points\tOnly 100 cases of this vintage-designated oloroso were made, and now it smells mature, nutty and oily.

The nose is definitely yeasty, with apple and green melon aromas. It's a bit soft for Cava, but that's because it's an '05 that rested on lees for years. Flavors of toasted bread and apple are long on complexity and short on fruit, but once again that's what distinguishes Gramona from the masses.\n76108\tSpain\tNumanthia\t91\t60\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNumanthia 2007 Numanthia  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tNumanthia\tGT_90_Points\tStocky, dark and pure, with inky aromas of shoe polish, black fruits and charcoal.

A nice mix of vanilla, root beer, spice, plum and chocolate aromas reflect 18 months in oak. With full stout tannins and deep ripe flavors of plum, cassis, tobacco and chocolate, this barrel-influenced middleweight should age nicely through 2022.\n121942\tSpain\tJuegabolos\t96\t50\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValderiz 2014 Juegabolos  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinta del Pais\tValderiz\tGT_90_Points\tToasty aromas suggest maple, along with a note of sawdust to accompany earthy berry scents. A rich, pure palate is intense but shows balance and comportment. Blackberry, cassis, peppery spice and integrated oak flavors are detailed, with a smooth finish. Drink this full-bodied wonder through 2028.\n121810\tSpain\tAlfar Reserva Edici??n Limitada\t92\t40\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValdelacierva 2011 Alfar Reserva Edici??n Limitada  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tValdelacierva\tGT_90_Points\tRipe cassis and berry aromas come with common Rioja side notes of vanilla, cedar and tobacco.

Lopez de Heredia 2003 Vi?ña Tondonia Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tR. Lopez de Heredia\tGT_90_Points\tIf this old-school winery has a signature wine, it's Tondonia. Hailing from the hot 2003 vintage, this smells rooty, with tobacco, cedar and subtle balsamic notes that only a few wines share, for instance the occasional Barolo. High acidity is keeping this vital, while flavors of tomato, currant and raspberry come with caramel and chocolate notes. The finish, which is subtle and long, is a highlight. Drink through 2020.\n124684\tSpain\tReserva\t92\t38\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRemelluri 2009 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tRemelluri\tGT_90_Points\tImmediately this smells complete and lusty: aromas of lemon peel, berry fruits, vanilla and char are attractive. In the mouth, this feels robust but blocky and tannic. Flavors of plum and blueberry are peppery and moderately complex, while this is drawing, dry and tannic on the finish. Drink through 2022.\n126365\tSpain\tGlorioso Gran Reserva\t90\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2001 Glorioso Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tGT_90_Points\tOpens with earth, tobacco, briar and nutty aromas. This is now aged to its best state, and while there's still some tannic bite, it's at a straightforward, mature place. Flavors of roasted plum and spice are classy, and the finish is reflective of a fine vintage. Drink now or in the near future.\n126770\tSpain\tSemele\t91\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMontebaco 2011 Semele  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tMontebaco\tGT_90_Points\tBlackberry, dark plum, mineral, char and leather aromas are what you want from a quality wine from Ribera del Duero.

A bruising wine with boysenberry, blackberry, mint, licorice and chocolate for primary flavors, and then lemony oak as a backdrop.

Feels raring to go, with pumped-up acidity that boosts otherwise normal flavors of dried white fruits, mixed nuts and brine. Tight, long and driving on the finish.\n124383\tSpain\tMalleolus\t90\t73\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmilio Moro 2008 Malleolus  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tEmilio Moro\tGT_90_Points\tGood berry aromas form a nice opening, and there are solid spice and herbal notes to boot. Feels juicy, well-cut and tighter than in years past, with blackberry, tea, spice and cured meat flavors. Oaky on the back side, but complex and showing potential. Hold through 2013, then drink.\n124384\tSpain\t\t90\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca La Mata 2009  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo\tFinca La Mata\tGT_90_Points\tPacked tight with power and minty, earthy berry aromas that come with a dry dustiness.

The palate feels ripe and intense, with creamy oak and controlled tannins. Flavors of baked black fruits, cocoa and vanilla finish soft and supple, with just enough tannic grip and acidity to maintain focus. Drink from 2014ƒ??2020.\n123081\tSpain\tClio\t93\t46\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Nido 2006 Clio Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tEl Nido\tGT_90_Points\tOddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb. Maybe that's because Monastrell is the go-to grape in Jumilla, and this is 70% Monastrell and only 30% Cab compared to the opposite with El Nido. All that said, this wine is ripe, approachable and dark, with excellent balance and a fudgy, warm finish of fruitcake and blackberry. Drink now through 2013.\n126042\tSpain\tGran Colegiata Campus\t92\t80\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fari?ña 2011 Gran Colegiata Campus  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tBodegas Fari?ña\tGT_90_Points\tChar and wood grain are prominent on a smoky nose with blackberry and black-currant aromas.

Flavors of blackberry, cassis and prune end with cookie-like notes of Graham cracker as well as toast. As a whole, this Syrah-Garnacha-Cabernet Sauvignon blend is muscular, tannic and brawny; drink through 2020.\n125338\tSpain\tVi?ña Pomal Reserva\t90\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Bilbainas 2011 Vi?ña Pomal Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Bilbainas\tGT_90_Points\tSmooth true Rioja aromas of ripe and dried berry fruits, tobacco, vanilla and sandalwood do the job, while this feels both racy and cushioned.

The palate is lush, meaty, jammy and borderline syrupy, while flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate finish with depth and extreme richness. Drink through 2025.\n128277\tSpain\tSingle Vineyard Estate Bottled\t92\t40\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Gri?ñon 2011 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Petit Verdot (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tPetit Verdot\tMarques de Gri?ñon\tGT_90_Points\tBlack in color, this Petit Verdot smells of iodine, black currant, road tar and leather. The palate is saturated, with a burst of acidity creating zest and balance. Oaky, powerful blackberry flavors shorten up on a muscular, tannic finish. Drink through 2021.\n128365\tSpain\tParaje de Cueva Baja\t94\t150\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTerreus 2010 Paraje de Cueva Baja Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tRed Blend\tTerreus\tGT_90_Points\tLoamy berry, blackberry pie and pastry aromas are like the red carpet at a big event. This is the epitome of a lush, layered, structured Tempranillo. Borderline syrupy flavors of blackberry, coffee and mocha end with chocolate and vanilla richness as well as lusty boldness.

Blackberry, cassis and roasted black-plum flavors are appropriate given the wine's hefty build. Finishing flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and baking spices are long and thorough. Drink this powerful Tempranillo-led blend through 2030.\n128629\tSpain\t\t91\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMorgad??o 2015 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tMorgad??o\tGT_90_Points\tAromas of melon, lime and stream water are just right. This has a crystal clear sense of freshness to the palate along with lime, peach and melon flavors that coast on fine acidity and finish in refreshing fashion.\n129881\tSpain\t\t90\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMartinsancho 2015 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tMartinsancho\tGT_90_Points\tThis Verdejo smells like citrus fruits and wild field grass, with a hint of feline aroma. Crisp and fresh, it offers flavors of melon, nectarine and nettle. A long, slightly salty finish is braced by bright acidity. Drink right away, if possible.\n128766\tSpain\tSanta Rosa Reserva\t91\t42\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnrique Mendoza 2011 Santa Rosa Reserva Red (Alicante)\tRed Blend\tEnrique Mendoza\tGT_90_Points\tDark, spicy scents run side by side with licorice root and black cherry notes. This juicy, layered blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% each of Merlot and Syrah is a potent number with black- and red-plum flavors backed by a lasting, bold, angular finish. Drink through 2023.\n129297\tSpain\tPayoya Negra\t90\t33\tAndalucia\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca la Melonera 2014 Payoya Negra Red\tRed Blend\tFinca la Melonera\tGT_90_Points\tJammy black-fruit aromas push up against raisiny but stay composed. This blend of Syrah, Garnacha, Tintilla and a grape called Rome feels rubbery and pulling, but solid. Blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors are chewy but focused. Drink through 2019.\n127574\tSpain\tMalleolus de Sanchomartin\t96\t204\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEmilio Moro 2006 Malleolus de Sanchomartin  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto del Pais\tEmilio Moro\tGT_90_Points\tTalk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.\n128955\tSpain\tChristina\t91\t90\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAstrales 2012 Christina  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tAstrales\tGT_90_Points\tMore than in the past, this vintage of Christina is showing a ton of oak up front along with vanilla, plastic and hickory aromas. Round, staunch and tannic on the palate, this single-vineyard Tinto Fino tastes toasted, blackened and minty, with blackberry, peppercorn and licorice flavors; hold until 2017.\n127076\tSpain\tAlmirez\t92\t26\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTeso La Monja 2011 Almirez  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tTeso La Monja\tGT_90_Points\tBlack in color and concentrated on the nose, this Tinta de Toro overflows with cassis and blackberry aromas. The palate is lively and lifted, with plenty of acidity and kick.

A clampy tannic, high-energy palate is emboldened by penetrating acidity, while flavors of plum, berry, tomato and spice are lifted by that same acidity. This is still young, jagged and abrasive on the finish. Drink through 2028.\n127224\tSpain\tValbuena 5\t94\t230\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega Sicilia 2011 Valbuena 5  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tVega Sicilia\tGT_90_Points\tSuper tight, toasty berry and spice aromas are classic RDD. This is tannic as nails right now, but the future, albeit one that's down the road, is positively bright. Flavors of mocha, blackberry, espresso and toast finish hard and tannic. If ever a wine was made for long-term cellaring, this is it. Drink from 2019 through 2040.\n127516\tSpain\tSelecci??n Especial 1\t90\t19\tAndalucia\tM?­laga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJorge Ord???ñez & Co. 2015 Selecci??n Especial 1 Moscatel (M?­laga)\tMoscatel\tJorge Ord???ñez & Co.\tGT_90_Points\tDon't let the near nonexistence of color fool you, because this is a nice racy-sweet Moscatel. Aromas of citrus peel and air freshener are mild, while this feels juicy. Tropical fruit and citrus flavors finish lean except for a touch of viscosity.\n438\tSpain\tS??culo\t89\t15\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinos de Arganza 2012 S??culo Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tVinos de Arganza\tLT_90_Points\tFresh, focused and tight on the nose, with an undertone of mild oak and earth, this gets going with ease. A fresh, fruity palate is just rugged enough, while flavors of black plum, cherry, licorice and herbs finish toasty, spicy and firm.\n952\tSpain\tXIC\t87\t16\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAgust??

This varietal Xarel-lo feels citrusy and spunky; flavors of melon, orange and nectarine are good but standard on the finish. Overall, this is linear and fairly basic for white wine.\n958\tSpain\tWine Wings Garnacha\t87\t18\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIgnacio Mar??n 2015 Wine Wings Garnacha Ros??

Now it shows a controlled lees character along with lemon and apple flavors. Limited in what it offers, but made well.\n1701\tSpain\tDo?ña Beatriz\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Cerrosol 2006 Do?ña Beatriz Sauvignon (Rueda)\tSauvignon\tBodegas Cerrosol\tLT_90_Points\tThis tiny production SB is sweet and easygoing, with canned peach aromas along with pineapple and mild citrus flavors. Roundness and a smooth feel work in the wine's favor, because there's just enough acidity to push the length on the finish. Drink right away.\n1259\tSpain\t\t85\t7\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2010 Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tBramble and red berry aromas are attractive and almost exotic.

But in the mouth, it's lean to the point of being thin, with sharp acidity and tight red plum, pie cherry and herbal flavors. Short on the finish, with tang and scour.\n244\tSpain\tHerederos de Fran??ois Lurton Villafrance de Duero\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJ. & F.

Feels a little sticky on the finish, with firm tannins.\n81\tSpain\t\t86\t16\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSpyro 2014 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tSpyro\tLT_90_Points\tBland, mature aromas of white fruits are on the weak side for Albari?ño. This feels round and oily, while briny leesy flavors lack pop and precision. A grabby aged finish is short on the free flow that this grape and region are known for. Drink immediately or wait for a newer vintage.\n3518\tSpain\tFloreano e Punto\t88\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Carballal 2015 Floreano e Punto Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tBodegas Carballal\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of orange pulp and peel are hanging in there. This feels both oily and citric, while sour-leaning citrus flavors are a bit salty. On the finish, this feels plump and holds onto its citrusy essence. Drink immediately.\n3897\tSpain\tRoble\t86\t15\tLevante\tYecla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValle de Salinas 2008 Roble Red (Yecla)\tRed Blend\tValle de Salinas\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with common berry fruit aromas as well as a medicinal, minty note. The palate has short length and definition along with bouncy medium-depth berry flavors. Warm, simple touches of licorice and mint define the finish. A blend of 60% Monastrell with 20% each Syrah and Tempranillo.\n2534\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrus 2012 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinta Fina\tTrus\tLT_90_Points\tGritty, lightly stalky aromas of herbal blackberry smell a bit roasted and/or burnt. This is medium-full in body, with drying tannins. Roasted, tarry plum and berry flavors finish with peppery spice and heat.\n3718\tSpain\tEl Albar Lurton Barricas\t88\t24\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFran??ois Lurton 2009 El Albar Lurton Barricas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tTempranillo\tFran??ois Lurton\tLT_90_Points\tBig and forward on the bouquet, this has loud, fiery black-cherry and berry aromas. Like most Lurton wines of Spanish origin, El Albar is chewy and ripe, with a syrupy feel and flavors of blackberry, stewed plum and spice cake. The finish is chocolaty, beefy and concentrated.\n3720\tSpain\t\t88\t12\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo Serantellos 2011 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tPazo Serantellos\tLT_90_Points\tMinerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense. The palate offers good acidity and razor-sharp clarity, along with flavors of pineapple and apple. Alert on the finish, this is a firm refresher.\n2548\tSpain\t\t89\t15\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2015 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tRam??n Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tApple and melon aromas are clean, stony and direct. This feels juicy while also offering ample body weight. Tangerine and nectarine flavors finish long, minerally and ripe, with none of Albari?ño's common pithy bitterness.\n2818\tSpain\t\t86\t25\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAttis 2013 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tAttis\tLT_90_Points\tDusty, leesy aromas are powdery, with little fruit character.

The palate is blocky yet dominated by acidity, while flavors of plum, black currant and woodspice are exotic. A hard finish shows hickory and barrel flavors along with wiry acidity.\n3032\tSpain\tEstate Grown/Vi?ñedo Propio\t88\t20\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFillaboa 2015 Estate Grown/Vi?ñedo Propio Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tFillaboa\tLT_90_Points\tFleshy oily aromas of orange peel and white flowers lead to a chunky, citric palate that's more full and blocky than elegant.

This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.\n3302\tSpain\tBrut Ros??\t87\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCodorn??u NV Brut Ros?? Pinot Noir (Cava)\tPinot Noir\tCodorn??u\tLT_90_Points\tThis one takes on an orange tint, and the aromas are akin to chocolate, spice cake and even some baked beans. The palate is quite crisp and healthy, with berry fruit, citrus and length. A good wine with a racy, cleansing feel. It's not spectacular but it ranks highly among similar competitors.\n3408\tSpain\t\t83\t11\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Salazar 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tSauvignon Blanc\tFinca Salazar\tLT_90_Points\tOily aromas of orange peel are inoffensive. A shearing palate offers little textural pleasure or complexity. Flavors of lemon and blood orange finish with a sour note of underripe pineapple.\n3919\tSpain\tOld Vines\t87\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNisia 2014 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNisia\tLT_90_Points\tApple, peach and melon aromas are clean and fruity. The palate on this Verdejo is melony, which matches the wine's melon and papaya flavors. On the finish, a note of apple cider is detectable. Because of moderate acidity and some flab, it's advisable to drink this now.\n3040\tSpain\tRosado\t88\t17\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas Pere NV Rosado Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMas Pere\tLT_90_Points\tThis salmon-colored ros?? is made from the Trepat grape. It smells common, with yeasty bready notes of orange peel and orange blossom. A basic palate is balanced, while this tastes of leesy dried melon prior to a medium-long finish.\n4016\tSpain\tBrut Reserva Ros??\t88\t24\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLlopart 2010 Brut Reserva Ros??

This is full-bodied Cava with a smooth, robust finish.\n3224\tSpain\tRSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma\t88\t75\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tReal Sitio de Ventosilla 2004 RSV 1601 El Duque de Lerma  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tReal Sitio de Ventosilla\tLT_90_Points\tWith damp earth and crusty leather aromas, this is a heavy wine with baked fruit, a syrupy mouthfeel and flavors of mocha, carob, leafy berry and earth. On the finish, it's full bodied and soft, with ripe black-fruit flavors that register as thick and a touch raisiny. Drink now.\n3318\tSpain\tPetit Albet\t87\t13\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlbet I Noya 2009 Petit Albet White (Pened??s)\tWhite Blend\tAlbet I Noya\tLT_90_Points\tMinerally, dry and clean white wine made from 60% Xarello and 40% Chardonnay. The nose is peachy, while the palate is spritzy and bouncy, with short, slightly creamy apple, melon and papaya flavors that are true to Xarello. Finishes smooth but a little flat.\n1810\tSpain\t\t85\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMantel Blanco 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tMantel Blanco\tLT_90_Points\tStone-fruit aromas are the opening, and they're on the full, waxy, fleshy side. This weighs in with low acidity, and that results in broad flavors of papaya and green melon. A round finish, much like the nose, shows a fleshy component.\n3754\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2015 Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tLightly pickled citrus aromas include a note of pyrazines. Direct on the palate, with a reasonably good mouthfeel, this delivers short flavors of stone fruits in front of a finish that's mildly pithy and bitter.\n3321\tSpain\t\t87\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValserrano 2004  Rioja\tGraciano\tValserrano\tLT_90_Points\tA snappy, high-acid wine that pulses with red fruit aromas and flavors. It's sheering, which is normal for the Graciano variety, but it also tastes nice while delivering a bolt of raspberry and red plum flavor. Oak comes up late, providing a counterweight of vanilla and dry spice. Nice but like all varietal Gracianos, it's sharp and limited.\n3935\tSpain\tRosado\t83\t14\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOchoa 2010 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tOchoa\tLT_90_Points\tSalmon colored, with somewhat flat aromas of peach and sweet melon. Sweet on the palate, with weight and thickness along with cantaloupe and a candied aftertaste. Finishes chunky and flat; tasted twice with inconsistent findings. This note reflects the better bottle.\n1833\tSpain\tAgost??n\t84\t13\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Paniza 2013 Agost??n Viura-Chardonnay (Cari?ñena)\tViura-Chardonnay\tBodegas Paniza\tLT_90_Points\tThis Viura-Chardonnay blend smells odd, as if musky cologne was blended with body oil. The palate seems caught between heavy and racy, while flavors of candied white fruits, apple and pear come with residual sugar and a sketchy foundation.\n1835\tSpain\tCrianza\t84\t25\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Arn?­iz 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tVi?ña Arn?­iz\tLT_90_Points\tChunky, raisiny lead aromas come with more than enough vanilla, mocha and creamy oak backing. This has a lazy, baked, tannic feel and heavy flavors of candied blackberry and creamy oak. It smells and tastes forced.\n3767\tSpain\t\t86\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres 2013 Ros?? (Rioja)\tRos??\tMarqu??s de C?­ceres\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and raspberry aromas are fresh, clean and simple. A juicy, direct palate brings cherry and plum skin flavors with citric acid for cleansing purposes. This ros?? is the definition of a simple summer quaffer.\n3329\tSpain\tIsabelino\t87\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tReina de Castilla 2009 Isabelino Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)\tVerdejo-Viura\tReina de Castilla\tLT_90_Points\tMaybe it's the Viura, becuase this $9 wine seems cleaner, rounder and slightly better than the winery's higher-priced pure Verdejos. Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.\n3154\tSpain\tCeleste Crianza\t89\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2005 Celeste Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tTorres' Celeste debuted in 2003, and the '05 is the best vintage to date. The wine has penetrating berry and spice aromas and an accent of animal leather. The palate is healthy and polished, with plum, blackberry and herbal notes. Comes together well and should be good in the cellar through 2012.\n1843\tSpain\t\t83\t25\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tZudugarai 2013 White (Getariako Txakolina)\tWhite Blend\tZudugarai\tLT_90_Points\tOxidized, yeasty aromas are not fresh. On the palate, this is spritzy, but oxidation creates a yeasty, bready blanket on top of basic pear and papaya. It finishes flat.\n1846\tSpain\tFermentado en Barrica\t83\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEresma 2012 Fermentado en Barrica Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tEresma\tLT_90_Points\tGold in color, with a nutty, flabby nose. In the mouth, this is honeyed and mealy, while flavors of creamy oak, green herbs and stone fruits finish bland and soft.\n1848\tSpain\tEdicion Limitada\t83\t9\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaximo 2012 Edicion Limitada Garnacha (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tGarnacha\tMaximo\tLT_90_Points\tGrassy, stalky plum aromas are decent but not overly fresh. Without a lot of shape or body, this modest Garnacha is herbaceous and limited in red-fruit flavors. The finish is gone in a flash.\n1898\tSpain\tReserva Real\t89\t150\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2003 Reserva Real Red (Pened??s)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tPlenty of new oak is announced via aromas of coconut, mint, vanilla and burnt toast. but offsetting that is lively berry and cola flavors. As it opens and settles in, you get a wall of fierce tannins that aren't likely to fade any time soon. So unless you have years to cellar this wine, it will likely hold onto its hard, tannic personality. Hold another three years, if possible.\n3358\tSpain\tConde de Valdemar Old Vines\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2010 Conde de Valdemar Old Vines  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tRaisiny, pruny aromas are all that register on this rubbery, jammy Garnacha. Flavors of sweet plum, raspberry and raisin are chunky, while the finish is raisiny in flavor and rubbery in feel.\n3434\tSpain\t\t88\t24\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tChopo 2014 Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tChopo\tLT_90_Points\tJammy plum and berry aromas come with dessert herb scents. A juicy palate doesn't offer much structure, but this Monastrell-Syrah blend tastes good courtesy of plum, blackberry and toasty flavors. The ripe warm finish is generous.\n3439\tSpain\t\t88\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPalma Real 2015 Verdejo-Viura (Rueda)\tVerdejo-Viura\tPalma Real\tLT_90_Points\tMelon, nectarine and mild citrus aromas are clean and direct. This basic white is firm and balanced, while stone fruit, melon and white-pepper flavors end easy and fresh.\n2531\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tProelio 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tProelio\tLT_90_Points\tWiry cherry and herb aromas are fresh and reedy. This Rioja feels crisp and mildly astringent. Quick, punchy flavors of plum and wild berry fruits turn more oaky prior to a finish that's fresh and forward, with hard tannins. Drink through 2021.\n2806\tSpain\tTinto Rib??n Crianza\t87\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Rib??n 2012 Tinto Rib??n Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Rib??n\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of iodine, horse hide and saucy berry fruits are intriguing on the nose. The palate is tannic and mildly astringent offering rustic notes of baked, leathery black-fruit flavors. The finish is hot and jammy, with a leathery kick.\n3260\tSpain\tEl Picaro\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMatsu 2013 El Picaro  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tMatsu\tLT_90_Points\tRough, animal-like aromas wrestle with piercing, fairly hot plum and berry scents. Rubbery, blackened, peppery plum and raspberry flavors finish oaky, mildly bitter and tannic.\n3895\tSpain\tKickass\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Burro 2008 Kickass Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tEl Burro\tLT_90_Points\tDarker and earthier than most basic Garnachas, with aromas of compost, baked earth, crusty black fruits and leather. The palate has a nice, ripe, bodied feel, while flavors of blackberry and boysenberry bring just the slightest hint of herbal green. Toasty and solid on the finish.\n2894\tSpain\tEl P?­jaro Rojo\t86\t18\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLosada 2013 El P?­jaro Rojo Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tLosada\tLT_90_Points\tReduced, floral and plummy on the nose, this is a simple, blocky, tannic young wine. Medicinal berry flavors finish loud and grapy, with a grabby, tacky feel. Fruit outweighs finesse.\n2901\tSpain\tArnegui Reserva\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPagos del Rey 2008 Arnegui Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tPagos del Rey\tLT_90_Points\tWiry cherry aromas are a touch cheesy and also medicinal. This is pinched and astringent, with a choppy mix of buttery red-berry flavors and vanilla. Like most 2008s, this finishes hard and abrupt, with staunch tannins.\n2151\tSpain\tMade With Organic Grapes\t84\t11\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2015 Made With Organic Grapes Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy oak aromas sit atop wiry plum and spice scents. This feels tannic and tough, with up-front oak and herbal berry flavors. A dry tannic, spicy finish features palpable oak that tastes forced and like plastic.\n2154\tSpain\tEstate Wine Organic\t84\t18\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCampos de Risca 2013 Estate Wine Organic Monastrell-Syrah (Jumilla)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tCampos de Risca\tLT_90_Points\tDusty aromas of desert brush, oak, blueberry, animal hide and green herbs are strained. This feels raw and choppy, while reedy herbal red-fruit flavors finish with a note of raisin. This Monastrell (with 10% Syrah) is okay but all over the map.\n2162\tSpain\tCovello\t84\t16\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLo Nuevo 2015 Covello Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tLo Nuevo\tLT_90_Points\tLemon and apple aromas precede a high-acid citric palate without much elegance or finesse. This pedestrian Albari?ño deals pithy orange flavors that come with a note of grape skins. On the finish, this seems like orange juice.\n5526\tSpain\t\t82\t20\tCatalonia\tCosters del Segre\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCristiari 2013 Riesling (Costers del Segre)\tRiesling\tCristiari\tLT_90_Points\tThis Riesling smells slightly tropical but more like grass and asparagus. A linear body is propped up by lemony acidity, while flavors of lemon peel, tangerine and lees finish citric. Overall, this smells and tastes nothing like the Riesling most people know.\n5529\tSpain\tCrianza\t82\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDominio del Viento 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tDominio del Viento\tLT_90_Points\tCheesy, oaky aromas are staunch and less than appealing. A choppy, astringent palate and mulchy, briny berry flavors are less than helpful, while a rubbery feeling finish also fails to bring this around.\n5531\tSpain\tHermanos Lurton\t82\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFran??ois Lurton 2013 Hermanos Lurton Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tFran??ois Lurton\tLT_90_Points\tSeltzer and sauerkraut are off putting on the nose.

This Tempranillo from the Granada area is tightly wound, with crisp, dry flavors of prune, vanilla and raw oak. Overall this seems a bit cooked and past its prime.\n2736\tSpain\tMenguante\t86\t14\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ñedos y Bodegas Pablo 2014 Menguante Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tVi?ñedos y Bodegas Pablo\tLT_90_Points\tBlack cherry and plum aromas are solid. This is chunky and heavyset, but comfortable across the palate.

In the mouth, it registers as full-bodied, while the flavor profile is chunky and dry, with early signs of oxidation that are confirmed on a low-steam finish.

This is chunky in feel, with light acidity that tries to keep things from coming across cloying. Candied flavors could use more dryness and elegance, while the finish is sweet and tastes of brown sugar and berry syrup.\n2752\tSpain\t\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRio Madre 2014  Rioja\tTempranillo\tRio Madre\tLT_90_Points\tReedy red-fruit aromas lack the clarity that the best wines of this style show.

Quick, round and solid on the finish, which lingers for quite some time. A fine summer sipper.\n5830\tSpain\tHonoro Vera\t84\t8\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuan Gil 2012 Honoro Vera Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tJuan Gil\tLT_90_Points\tLight, mildly stalky aromas of grassy red fruits are on the raw and simple side.

Thick and full-bodied in the mouth, this has flavors of blackberry, creamy oak, chocolate and vanilla. It feels broad and just bright enough on the finish.\n2285\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t25\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDamalisco 2008 Crianza  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tDamalisco\tLT_90_Points\tAfter opening with reedy, stalky aromas, this is raw and choppy on the palate. Flavors of herbal red plum and rhubarb conclude with tight, edgy acids and a bit of burn and heat. This is fresh and generally pretty good, but it lacks Toro's usual richness and power.\n4570\tSpain\tAdivino Tinto Joven\t85\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCovila 2015 Adivino Tinto Joven  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCovila\tLT_90_Points\tFiery cherry cough-drop aromas are basic at best, crude at worst.

This basic Rioja feels sturdy and solid, while flavors of spicy oak accent plum and berry fruit. A medium-long finish with resiny, peppery notes is a touch hot.\n4088\tSpain\tParticular\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas San Valero 2013 Particular Chardonnay (Cari?ñena)\tChardonnay\tBodegas San Valero\tLT_90_Points\tThis leads with leesy flavors of melon and stone fruits, followed by mild citric acidity that drives the palate. Flavors of stone-fruit pits and nectarine are a touch bitter, while the finish is minerally, with a shot of lemon zest.\n5082\tSpain\tGarnacha\t87\t10\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnanzo 2013 Garnacha Rosado (Navarra)\tRosado\tEnanzo\tLT_90_Points\tSnappy, dry red-fruit and citrus aromas are a good opening. The palate is fresh and bouncy, with punchy pomegranate and grapefruit flavors. A zesty finish with mild citrus and nectarine flavors is par for the course.\n4604\tSpain\t\t87\t8\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Tarima 2009 Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBodegas Tarima\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery and roasted, but not too much so. Otherwise one should look for medicinal berry aromas followed by flavors of baked plum, prune and black pepper. The finish is dense, a touch flat, and chocolaty; overall this is a chunky, sweet performer.\n4406\tSpain\tSelecci??

The palate is jumpy and slightly medicinal, with currant, tomato, herb and plum flavors running the show. Medium in size, with level tannins and a juicy, good overall feel to it.\n4415\tSpain\tMR Mountain Wine\t89\t38\tAndalucia\tM?­laga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2012 MR Mountain Wine Moscatel (M?­laga)\tMoscatel\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of orange blossom, clover and honey are true to sun-dried Moscatel grapes. This feels thick and chunky on the palate, but also a bit soft and flat. Flavors of honey and brown sugar are creamy, with modest acidic cut. A slightly cloying finish continues that theme.\n5170\tSpain\tEnvite Crianza\t87\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas San Prudencio 2007 Envite Crianza  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tBodegas San Prudencio\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.\n4532\tSpain\tRosado\t82\t11\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Albret 2011 Rosado Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tFinca Albret\tLT_90_Points\tThis barrel-fermented ros?? is flat and smells more like apple juice than wine. Despite showing some tang, this is dull in the mouth, with bland orange and nectarine flavors. On the finish, it's washed out and has an iodine-like aftertaste.\n7837\tSpain\tCosecha\t87\t7\tLevante\tJumilla\t\t\t\tMayoral 2000 Cosecha Red (Jumilla)\tTempranillo Blend\tMayoral\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium-to full-bodied red from Spain's southeast sports a potent, inviting nose. Black plum, soy, leather and oak merge in an appealing, inky opening. The black cherry flavors are quite dry, but also rich and palate-coating. Finishes with substantial tannins. The wine should drink even better in one or two years, but should pair well with hearty fare even now.

This feels racy and wild, but lively. Briny, rugged flavors of raspberry and plum finish tart, with a pickled note that won't let go.\n7341\tSpain\tArgos\t88\t20\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaior de Mendoza 2012 Argos Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tMaior de Mendoza\tLT_90_Points\tMelon, peach, leesy vanilla and mineral aromas are what you want from this type of wine. The palate is juicy and fresh, with nectarine, orange and pineapple flavors. A racy finish is confirmation of this Albari?ño's zesty character.\n7346\tSpain\tEstate Bottled\t88\t9\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPaso a Paso 2012 Estate Bottled Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tPaso a Paso\tLT_90_Points\tRobust black-fruit aromas suggest plum and blackberry. This everyday red is concentrated, generous and packed with power. Flavors of dark berry fruits, chocolate and espresso finish with verve and clarity.\n4555\tSpain\tRam??n Roqueta\t81\t12\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas 1898 2009 Ram??n Roqueta Garnacha (Catalunya)\tGarnacha\tBodegas 1898\tLT_90_Points\tThis reedy, strained Garnacha features cheesy aromas, stalky fruit and chemical notes.

The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth. Flavors of blackberry, spice and jammy syrup lead to a finish with a chocolaty tone. Tasted twice, with consistent results.\n4460\tSpain\tOrganic\t85\t8\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVicente Gandia 2010 Organic Cabernet Sauvignon (Spain)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVicente Gandia\tLT_90_Points\tThe tea and raspberry aromas are easygoing, and that best describes this organic Cabernet Sauvignon. It's powerful enough on the palate, with a good berry flavor that tilts towards raspberry. The finish is herbal and peppery.\n7363\tSpain\t\t88\t25\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tZarate 2012 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tZarate\tLT_90_Points\tThis shows stalky, corny notes on the nose along with mineral and white-fruit scents. There's a lemony quality to an otherwise neutral palate, while saline, lemon and mild but increasing bitterness control the flavor profile and finish.\n5075\tSpain\tSmooth Red\t87\t8\tCentral Spain\tValdepe?ñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Albali 2012 Smooth Red Tempranillo (Valdepe?ñas)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Albali\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry and cherry aromas are juicy and wiry, with no fat at all.

This Garnacha-Carignan blend is rough as sandpaper, with heavily oaked flavors of herbaceous black fruits. A rough and rugged finish is abrasive.\n6858\tSpain\tVenta Mazzaron\t89\t18\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ñas del Cenit 2014 Venta Mazzaron Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tTempranillo\tVi?ñas del Cenit\tLT_90_Points\tA dark, roasted, smoky opening is the greeting on this burly Tempranillo from Zamora. Grabbing tannins pinch like squeaky rubbery, while this tastes of savory, roasted black fruits. A meaty, chewy, tannic finish is confirmation of overall toughness. Drink through 2021.\n6768\tSpain\t\t89\t17\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVal do Sosego 2012 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tVal do Sosego\tLT_90_Points\tWith proper doses of orange rind, vanilla, minerality and melon on the nose, this opens in very good form. The palate is round, pithy and citric in feel, while flavors of white grapefruit, orange and melon finish with a mild oily mouthfeel and a touch of bitterness.\n7439\tSpain\tVi?ña Sol\t86\t10\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2002 Vi?ña Sol White (Pened??s)\tWhite Blend\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tPine needle, lilac and some musk on the nose. Citrus is the driving force from then on. There's tangerine and some melon for flavor, and plenty or orange and passion fruit on the finish. A drink-now citrus ball that's full and flavorful.\n7544\tSpain\t\t87\t16\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJuan Gil 2007 Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tJuan Gil\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, meaty and leathery, with an herbal quality to the bouquet. The palate is chunky and soupy, with stewed berry, latent sweetness, and a mild herbal aftertaste. Seems syrupy at points and then fresher and better at other times. Has its good qualities but finishes short.\n7056\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron De Ley 2014 White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tBaron De Ley\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy, creamy aromas of vanilla are simple, with a note of apple offering some crispness.

Flavors of green apple, lettuce and herbs culminate with mild bitterness and green notes.\n7061\tSpain\tFamily Estate Selection\t84\t20\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastro Martin 2013 Family Estate Selection Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tCastro Martin\tLT_90_Points\tOrange peel aromas are a bit stony. In the mouth, this feels like it's past its prime, with little to no intensity or acidity. Mild apple flavors are sweet, mealy and honeyed, while the ending is leesy and mushy.\n7699\tSpain\tVi?ña Sanzo\t86\t9\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValsanzo 2005 Vi?ña Sanzo Tempranillo (Rueda)\tTempranillo\tValsanzo\tLT_90_Points\tFor a basic Tempranillo from Rueda, there's nothing not to like about this wine. It's snappy and fresh, maybe a bit sharp, but not spiky. The flavors are of berry and cherry, and the feel is tight but solid, with some juicy depth. Drink it like you might Beaujolais.\n7705\tSpain\tJoven Roble\t86\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de los Capellanes 2006 Joven Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tPago de los Capellanes\tLT_90_Points\tFairly ripe and deep smelling, yet it's more racy and lean in the mouth. There's good berry fruit to this Tempranillo-led wine, but it turns kind of sharp and sheering on the back palate. Freshness and snappy zest are the wine's main characteristics. Probably best with tapas.\n7707\tSpain\tGran Reserva de Familia\t86\t20\tCentral Spain\tValdepe?ñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Albali 1998 Gran Reserva de Familia Red (Valdepe?ñas)\tTempranillo Blend\tVi?ña Albali\tLT_90_Points\tThis blend of 85% Tempranillo and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon is light and leafy but not dirty or harsh. It's a thin-sided, tangy sort of wine with as much citrus as there is berry fruit. For something aged and mild, it's pretty good but not what you'd call substantial. Imported by Luneau USA Inc.\n6507\tSpain\tL'Efecte Volador\t81\t15\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJosep Grau Viticultor 2015 L'Efecte Volador Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tJosep Grau Viticultor\tLT_90_Points\tHot rubbery untamed aromas need help. This Syrah-led blend feels clampy and rough. Salty murky black-fruit flavors are herbal and wild, and there's no help coming on the finish, which is grabby.\n6509\tSpain\tBarrica\t81\t29\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAltos de Torona 2013 Barrica Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tAltos de Torona\tLT_90_Points\tOxidized apricot aromas comprise the bulk of the nose on this weird oak-aged Albari?ño. Flavors of apricot, peach pit and quince quickly turn bitter, while the finish is flabby. Overall this is sketchy, with few attributes.\n7816\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t11\tCentral Spain\tValdepe?ñas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Albali 2004 Reserva Tempranillo (Valdepe?ñas)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Albali\tLT_90_Points\tA mature, more traditional Spanish wine that's ready to drink. The nose mixes tomato leaf, mint and maturing berry aromas, while the starchy, grabby palate shows aging raspberry and strawberry fruit with ample leather and dryness. Caramel, vanilla and toast notes grace the finish.\n10058\tSpain\tQuintaluna\t88\t19\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOssian 2015 Quintaluna Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tVerdejo\tOssian\tLT_90_Points\tBasic aromas of apple and melon feed into a solid round palate with good acidity.

This feels fresh, stony, acidic and narrow on the palate. Briny, citrusy flavors are more generic than particular, while the finish tastes like briny citrus, with an aftertaste of salty tang.\n7717\tSpain\tArderius Reserva\t86\t28\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Leza Garc??a 2001 Arderius Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Leza Garc??a\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose blends overtly floral, fruity lead aromas with secondary notes of shoe polish and leather, but in the end it's a little mute. The mouth offers standard plum and berry flavors, while the mouthfeel is chunky and generally quite pure. This is not a thoroughbred, but it's more than a good plow horse.\n6523\tSpain\tCrianza\t83\t15\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGladium 2009 Crianza Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tGladium\tLT_90_Points\tStewy yet flush, with shearing acids, this has a meaty, leafy aroma that sets up the angular palate.

It smells of apples and melon, and the flavors go straight to lemon curd, green apple and kiwi. Fairly long and cleansing on the finish, with a nice mouthfeel. Drink now.\n6796\tSpain\tHacienda de Susar\t89\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de la Concordia 2007 Hacienda de Susar  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tMarqu??s de la Concordia\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this wine is condensed and tight, with snappy berry aromas that come across fresh.

It's a fresh yet oaky type of Rioja, with resiny creaminess cut by lively acidity. Flavors of vanilla, plum, raspberry and tobacco are traditional, while the finish is mild, crisp and snappy.

It feels grabby and gritty, with strong tannic bite and black fruit flavors. It retains a ruggedness on the finish, along with molasses and chocolate flavors.\n7668\tSpain\tOpera Prima\t85\t6\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJ.

The palate has a standard, competent feel and balance along with flavors of gangly berry fruit and black cherry. Mocha and vanilla help sweeten and soften up the finish, but overall it's a regular, fresh type of wine.\n9357\tSpain\tDamalisco\t84\t13\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValsanzo 2006 Damalisco  (Toro)\tTempranillo\tValsanzo\tLT_90_Points\tLots of leather and churned earth on the nose, and with time plum and tomato notes enter the party. It's a forward, aggressive Tempranillo with jumpy red-fruit flavors and a long, angular finish. Not really a wine for connoisseurs, but good for everyday consumption.\n9360\tSpain\tJoven\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArroyo 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tArroyo\tLT_90_Points\tBig and sweet, with ripe berry aromas, candy and leather on the nose. This wine is a classic fruity joven; it's bulky and easygoing, with black cherry, raspberry and chocolate. If you aren't looking for miracles, this is fine within the young Ribera del Duero category.\n9693\tSpain\tGlorioso Crianza\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2006 Glorioso Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tBegins with muddled, murky, syrupy aromas of caramel and berries. The palate is more high-toned, with lemony accents to tomato, baked fruit and savory flavors. Finishes solid albeit lightly damp and bitter. Comes around with time but always seems a bit murky.\n9089\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t57\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de Carraovejas 2006 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tPago de Carraovejas\tLT_90_Points\tBig, bawdy, hard and concentrated, with black fruit and floral aromas. The palate is grabby and fully tannic, while the flavors run toward blackberry, coffee and vanilla. Rich and espresso-like on the finish, with no shortage of oak and richness. Very big at 15% alcohol.\n10078\tSpain\tSierra de Miros Reserva\t88\t35\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Pe?ñafiel 2011 Sierra de Miros Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Pe?ñafiel\tLT_90_Points\tUnusual exotic-leaning aromas of lavender, violet, cardamom and anise are intriguing. In the mouth, this has textural issues, namely it's abrupt and tannic. Flavors of mild chocolate, carob and blueberry are uncommon for Ribera del Duero.\n9699\tSpain\tAzagador Vi?ñedos Propios Crianza\t86\t10\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de la Jaraba 2007 Azagador Vi?ñedos Propios Crianza Red (La Mancha)\tTempranillo Blend\tPago de la Jaraba\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of balsam wood, dry leather, and slightly herbal berry fruit are generally appealing, while the palate has size, balance and a healthy feel to it. More woody and spicy than outright fruity, with a touch of zesty raspberry and strawberry at the core. Nice but simple red wine.\n9370\tSpain\tTinto Reserva\t83\t49\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de los Capellanes 2002 Tinto Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tPago de los Capellanes\tLT_90_Points\tEveryone who follows Spain and the Mediterranean basin knows that 2002 was a cool, miserly year. But still, this wine is offering almost nothing. It's tart, limited and borderline sour. There isn't much middle or body to it, so expect scratchy red fruit and lots of wayward acidity.\n8766\tSpain\t\t89\t15\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBula 2012 Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tBula\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky, charred aromas are rugged and center around black fruits. This is a blend of Mazuelo (Carignan), Garnacha and Syrah, and it's decidedly ripe. Loamy flavors of blackberry and plum are earthy, while the finish is toasty and ends with a bitter espresso note.\n9960\tSpain\t\t87\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tParamus 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tParamus\tLT_90_Points\tLeesy mango and lime aromas are fleshy, but attractive.

Flavors of raspberry and cherry are round and sort of earthy, while the tannin-to-acid balance is good. Finishes sort of narrow but with crusty tannins and stature. Drink now.\n9965\tSpain\tArindo\t87\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tShaya 2013 Arindo Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tShaya\tLT_90_Points\tClean, simple and fresh on the nose, this is showing aromas of lime and apple cider.

It's powerful juice, with a strong mineral/floral element on the bouquet. Aged only a year in oak, it maintains a crisp, charred character and shows tight raspberry flavors, chocolate and pepper. Features all the right stuff for a debut wine from a strained vintage.\n10187\tSpain\tSpiga\t87\t31\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tO.

In the mouth, it's saturated and intense as if offers up a meaty set of dense fruit flavors. Doesn't show as much complexity, layering and variety as we might like to see, but it's pretty flashy and good for a 2007, a vintage that was problematic in this region.\n10192\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFern?­ndez de Pi??rola 2004 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFern?­ndez de Pi??rola\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with leathery aromas suggestive of animal hide along with a leafy element and nuttiness.

The aromas are of sun-baked earth and dust, with a trace of vanilla and white chocolate. All you really experience on the palate is acidity, alcohol and weight, although if you try hard you can imagine a squeeze of lime.

Drink now.\n8690\tSpain\tLegado de Farro Roble\t88\t19\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinos de Arganza 2012 Legado de Farro Roble Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tVinos de Arganza\tLT_90_Points\tJammy blueberry aromas are grapy, with ample char and grit coming from background oak. This feels firm, wiry, grabby and drying. Jammy, herbal flavors of cassis and blueberry finish with big, rubbery, elastic tannins.\n13406\tSpain\t\t86\t17\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Pensador 2008 Tempranillo (Campo de Borja)\tTempranillo\tEl Pensador\tLT_90_Points\tRaisin, black plum and peppery aromas make for a good bouquet, and the palate is healthy and dark, with snappy black cherry and blackberry flavors floating on a current of zesty acidity. Full on the finish, but still there's some acidic scour. Best with food.\n13130\tSpain\t\t89\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVieira de Plata 2015 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tVieira de Plata\tLT_90_Points\tFloral, tropical-fruit aromas suggest orange and mango. This is juicy and under control on the palate, with dry yeasty white-fruit and citrus flavors. On the finish, this is showing ample freshness. Drink now.\n14203\tSpain\tTres Picos\t89\t17\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBorsao 2009 Tres Picos Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tBorsao\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy doses of char, rubber, graphite and hickory dance with black fruit aromas. Tastes big, rich, resiny and lemony, with a ton of barrel action forcing up chocolate, resin and dark spice flavors. Warm and long on the finish, with power to spare. 100% Garnacha.\n13682\tSpain\tMasos d'en Cubells\t86\t55\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCapafons-Oss?? 2003 Masos d'en Cubells Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tCapafons-Oss??\tLT_90_Points\tTime will only help this tough, rough Priorato that isn't offering a whole lot now besides tannin, dark-fruit flavors and searing oak. The flavors are middle-of-the-road in terms of friendliness and complexity, so expect a forward, hard-hitting wine. Should be more revealing in a few years.\n13665\tSpain\tBrut de Noirs\t86\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Brut de Noirs Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tSalmon colored, with forward aromas of dust, earth, spice and red fruits. The palate is nicely decorated with cherry notes and brown sugar, while the finish moves quickly from fruit to vanilla and cream soda. Nice but a touch confected.\n13670\tSpain\tBrut Reserva Cava\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSumarroca 2004 Brut Reserva Cava Sparkling (Pened??s)\tSparkling Blend\tSumarroca\tLT_90_Points\tNothing really sticks out on this perfectly good brut. It offers the basic aromas of green apple and lime, followed by flavors of apple juice, citrus and pineapple. It takes on weight as it opens and then finishes a bit sweet.\n12610\tSpain\tCoto Real Reserva\t86\t45\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2008 Coto Real Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tTobacco, dill and vanilla aromas transition to cherry and raspberry scents. The high-acid, cutting palate contains tart raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors that maintain through the finish. From a rough vintage, this wine is not excelling.\n14212\tSpain\t\t89\t14\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTemps de Flors 2010 White (Pened??s)\tWhite Blend\tTemps de Flors\tLT_90_Points\tThis three-grape blend of Xarello, Muscat and Gew?¬rztraminer is floral and inviting, with melony aromas. The palate is light but has stuffing and creamy edges. Tastes flowery, with green melon, lychee, honey and clover. Smooth, tasty and different.\n14214\tSpain\tGetaria\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tGetariako Txakolina\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTxom??n Etxan??z 2010 Getaria White (Getariako Txakolina)\tWhite Blend\tTxom??n Etxan??z\tLT_90_Points\tWhen caught fresh, this is one of the Txakoli region's best wines. It comes on hard, clacky and tight as a box of nails, with citrus and minerally aromas. The palate is crisp and tight, with apple, lime, kiwi and spritz. Long, clean and refreshing.\n13963\tSpain\tHado\t87\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPujanza 2010 Hado  (Rioja)\tRed Blend\tPujanza\tLT_90_Points\tEarly aromas of wet cement and rubber transition to leafy, herbal and mildly green. This feels tight, drawing and unforgiving. Flavors of leafy, roasted plum and berry are slightly stalky, while the finish is juicy in feel and herbal in flavor.\n13974\tSpain\t\t87\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tViridiana 2011  Ribera del Duero\tTinto Fino\tViridiana\tLT_90_Points\tTarry, rubbery aromas of blackened berry fruits lead to a full, wide palate, with ripe blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors. This is full of oak spice on a long, satisfying finish.\n14074\tSpain\t\t82\t9\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Copaboca 2008  Toro\tTempranillo-Garnacha\tBodegas Copaboca\tLT_90_Points\tCandied on one hand but also gassy, barnyardy and less than clean and pure on the other. A basic mouthfeel is probably the high point, while flavors of underdeveloped berry fruit are more salty and leathery than anything. Fails to impress.\n14079\tSpain\tRojo Granrojo\t82\t9\tCentral Spain\tTierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Navarro L??pez 2008 Rojo Granrojo Garnacha (Tierra de Castilla)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Navarro L??pez\tLT_90_Points\tFunky smelling and unfamiliar, with sweet, candied spice notes and strange candied cherry aromas. Vibrant and bouncy in terms of feel, but follows the nose by tasting sweet and weird. Weak on the finish as well.\n12520\tSpain\tVega Mont?­n\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Adri?­ 2009 Vega Mont?­n Menc??a (Bierzo)\tMenc??a\tBodegas Adri?­\tLT_90_Points\tLight and a little scratchy on the bouquet, with leathery notes. Feels fresh and kind of light in weight, with basic but clean red-fruit flavors and a dash of peppery spice. Flows easily on the finish, with a bit of fire and heat.\n13073\tSpain\tVi?ña Alarde\t86\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBerberana 2009 Vi?ña Alarde  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBerberana\tLT_90_Points\tBlack cherry and berry jam aromas bring a touch of raisin as well. The palate is mostly fresh and zesty, with medium weight and intensity along with crisp red plum and raspberry flavors. Tight, mildly acidic and a bit toasty on the finish.\n14290\tSpain\tGran Coronas\t86\t24\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTorres 2009 Gran Coronas Cabernet Sauvignon (Pened??s)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tTorres\tLT_90_Points\tSmoke and leather aromas come with earthy, leafy berry and floral scents. This is crisp and acidic in feel, while flavors of peppery red fruits are spicy and drawing. Raw tannins and red-fruit flavors carry the finish.\n13352\tSpain\tDo?ña Beatriz\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Cerrosol 2005 Do?ña Beatriz Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tBodegas Cerrosol\tLT_90_Points\tAdmittedly it's a bit late to be reviewing this 2005 Verdejo, but it's still fairly vital as it shows waxy citrus aromas in front of plump but anonymous white fruit. Still hanging in there with some persistence and mouthfeel, but get at it right away.\n13083\tSpain\tElyssia Pinot Noir Brut\t85\t18\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Elyssia Pinot Noir Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky on the nose, but also a bit harsh, with reedy, peppery notes. The palate is soft, creamy and low on acidity, with sweet, candied red fruit flavors that have a stalky, burnt edge. Goes down easy but has some sticking points.\n10651\tSpain\t\t87\t32\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConvento San Francisco 2006  Ribera del Duero\tTinto del Pais\tConvento San Francisco\tLT_90_Points\tAfter an aromatic opening that includes wet leather, rubber and brine, this wine finds its stride, and while it's firmly tannic, the flavors of dark fruits, tomato, herbs, tobacco and cured meats do the trick. It gets better the longer it sits; drink now but give it as much air as possible.\n12844\tSpain\tSelectus\t88\t70\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAljibes 2010 Selectus Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tAljibes\tLT_90_Points\tHot, tarry aromas of plum and berry rank as gritty and rough. Clampy, jagged tannins make for a tough mouthfeel, while a mix of herbal and jammy red-berry flavors turn salty before finishing with rubbery tannins. Drink through 2023.\n13092\tSpain\t\t85\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValdub??n 2009  Ribera del Duero\tTempranillo Blend\tValdub??n\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and spice aromas are fairly oaky and resiny. The palate is also resiny, with drying wood tannins along with clove and generic berry and cherry flavors. Tastes peppery and also like a clove-infused barrel on the finish.\n13362\tSpain\tCrianza\t85\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tConde de Siruela 2004 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tConde de Siruela\tLT_90_Points\tMore sharp and jumpy than many over-$20 wines from the region, but if you like a more racy, acidic style it may be up your alley. The wine offers blackberry flavors, spice and some herbal notes, while the finish thickens with mushroom and chocolate. A good but sketchy wine with a few loose ends.\n10669\tSpain\t\t84\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDon Olegario 2011 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tDon Olegario\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells stalky and past its prime, but it's not stinky or maderized. The palate is fleshy in feel and oily in sensation, with bitter citrus flavors and pithy notes. Neither vital nor fresh on the finish.\n10162\tSpain\tArienzo Crianza\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Riscal 2010 Arienzo Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqu??s de Riscal\tLT_90_Points\tLeathery, baked aromas of cheesy oak and red berry fruits are a bit lacking in pop but are reflective of typical Rioja Crianza. A full grabby palate shows earthy, buttery flavors of baked stalky berry fruits and oak. A grabby chunky finish wraps this up.\n13225\tSpain\tMade with Organic Grapes\t84\t10\tCentral Spain\tLa Mancha\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVenta Morales 2011 Made with Organic Grapes Tempranillo (La Mancha)\tTempranillo\tVenta Morales\tLT_90_Points\tFoxy aromas of plum and berry come with a dusting of spice and earthy accents. This feels sticky and a bit heavy, while blueberry and boysenberry flavors carry and herbal streak as well as minty notes and heat on the finish.\n10167\tSpain\t\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPingao 2013  Rioja\tTempranillo\tPingao\tLT_90_Points\tHarmonious but mild cherry and raspberry aromas are light and nice. This is substantive enough, with rubbery tannins and some chewiness to the palate. Generic flavors of raspberry and red plum finish mellow and easy.\n10680\tSpain\tSecreto Vendimia Seleccionada\t84\t\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Mayor 2009 Secreto Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Mayor\tLT_90_Points\tRough black-cherry and plum aromas are full and fruity. The palate is choppy, with prickly acidity leading to dry, hollow black-plum flavors. The wine shows color and size, with citrusy acid and astringency.\n13236\tSpain\t\t84\t11\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Coto 2012 Rosado (Rioja)\tRosado\tEl Coto\tLT_90_Points\tCitrusy aromas revolve around pink grapefruit and rose blossom. In the mouth, this is a bit flat for such a young ros??, with pithy and bitter flavors and notes of red plum and red-apple skins.\n12588\tSpain\tLimited Release\t86\t15\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVionta 2011 Limited Release Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tVionta\tLT_90_Points\tButterscotch and candle wax aromas signal a wine in the early stages of decline. In addition, this shows dusty apple and mild citrus scents. The palate is being kept upright by citrusy acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus end with bready, aged notes. Drink immediately or wait for the 2012.\n15867\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t23\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOstatu 2012 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tOstatu\tLT_90_Points\tJammy berry aromas include a seemingly misplaced note of cinnamon. This feels full, blocky and tannic, with old-fashioned clamp. Flavors of oak, plum and cherry form a familiar whole, while this tastes earthy and dry on the finish, with modest heat. Drink through 2021.\n12380\tSpain\tTemperamento\t85\t16\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Norte 2012 Temperamento Bobal (Utiel-Requena)\tBobal\tSierra Norte\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, muddled berry aromas are suggestive of prune and raisin. This is full and rugged on the palate, with leathery, baked plum and berry flavors that finish with a strong wood-based character and modest residual fruit notes.\n16289\tSpain\tCuv??e\t87\t15\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Hispana 2012 Cuv??e Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tFinca Hispana\tLT_90_Points\tBriary plum and cherry cough-drop aromas give way to a crisp, fairly full palate with chewy tannins. Plum and peppery spice flavors are kept simple, while this finishes with some dark-berry character and a touch of bitterness.\n16294\tSpain\tPremium Pedro Xim??nez\t87\t25\tAndalucia\tJerez\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDelgado Zuleta NV Premium Pedro Xim??nez Pedro Xim??nez (Jerez)\tPedro Xim??nez\tDelgado Zuleta\tLT_90_Points\tSimple brown sugar scents make for a monotone bouquet. Creamy and thick on the palate, this PX tastes largely of maple syrup and toffee. Overall, it delivers sweetness and toffee notes but not much complexity.\n13194\tSpain\tBrut\t86\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPata Negra NV Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tPata Negra\tLT_90_Points\tBready aromas feature melon as the main fruit scent. This is chunky in feel, with moderate acidity and cut. Apple, melon and green-herb flavors finish with hints of toast, yeast and generic sweetness.\n16021\tSpain\tRioja Bord??n Gran Reserva Tempranillo\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas 2005 Rioja Bord??n Gran Reserva Tempranillo  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Franco-Espa?ñolas\tLT_90_Points\tLightly spiced up front, with cinnamon and nutmeg aromas adding complex sweetness to cherry and cassis scents. It feels juicy and sincere, with a mix of berry, plum, herb, spice and licorice flavors. This turns toward vanilla on the finish. A traditional wine that's ready now.\n16022\tSpain\tSe?ñor??o del ?�guila Reserva\t88\t18\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Virgen del ?�guila 2004 Se?ñor??o del ?�guila Reserva Red (Cari?ñena)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Virgen del ?�guila\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy, meaty berry aromas are solid and sturdy. It feels fresh and lifted by lasting acidity, with flavors of raspberry, strawberry and vanilla that are easy to like. A wine to drink now without too much contemplation, this finishes steady and smooth.\n14880\tSpain\tLaudum Barrica Especial\t87\t18\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBocopa 2015 Laudum Barrica Especial Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tBocopa\tLT_90_Points\tHerbal aromas of tobacco and grass are light and spicy, reminiscent of Cabernet Sauvignon. A rubbery pinchy palate improves with airing, while this tastes of roasted black fruits and tomato. Herbal peppery chocolaty flavors are nice on the finish.\n16031\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t88\t22\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca del Marquesado 2003 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tFinca del Marquesado\tLT_90_Points\tMature, earthy and soft on the nose, with roasted, spicy, integrated berry aromas. Full but baked feeling, with maturity and monotone flavors of sweet berries that don't vary. It remains roasted and warm on the finish. Drink soon.\n12668\tSpain\tSelecci??n Especial Semi Seco\t83\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Monistrol NV Selecci??n Especial Semi Seco Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMarques de Monistrol\tLT_90_Points\tOpens with aromas of mustard and rye seed. The palate is soft, clunky and a bit cloying, with sweet, gummy, muddled apple and candied mango flavors. Finishes confected, with a tropical leaning. Not the best style for Cava.\n12674\tSpain\tConde de Haro Brut\t83\t27\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga NV Conde de Haro Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMuga\tLT_90_Points\tBready and lightly maderized, with less than fresh aromas. There's weight and maturity to this Cava along with doughy apple flavors. Sputters and flattens on the finish, which is chunky.\n16287\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondado de Oriza 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tCondado de Oriza\tLT_90_Points\tWiry aromas of berry and spice are tempered by a touch of oaky vanilla. On the palate, there's a blend of creamy oak and sharp acidity, while flavors of plum and boysenberry are tart overall but again softened by barrel-driven vanilla notes. Snappy acidity makes for a moderately sharp, pointed finish.\n15329\tSpain\tPrima\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaurodos 2011 Prima  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tMaurodos\tLT_90_Points\tEarth, leather, a touch of compost, soy, hoison sauce and raisin aromas all vie for attention on this tannic, ripe, almost stewy Toro. Seriously ripe flavors of sun-baked berry fruits and black currant veer towards prune and raisin on a rich, chocolaty, figgy finish.\n14360\tSpain\tMar??n Old Vine\t89\t18\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIgnacio Mar??n 2012 Mar??n Old Vine Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tIgnacio Mar??n\tLT_90_Points\tRipe raisin, vanilla, tobacco and cassis aromas are more than adequately oaked. This feels grippy and bold, with an oak-based resiny mouthfeel. Toasty blueberry and blackberry flavors finish with a final note of oak and heat.\n12694\tSpain\tTarima\t84\t9\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolver 2012 Tarima White (Alicante)\tWhite Blend\tVolver\tLT_90_Points\tIn this very basic wine, applesauce aromas are followed by a plump, somewhat citrusy feeling palate. Flavors of nectarine are good and clean, while the finish is solid.\n15812\tSpain\tWhite\t85\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBorsao 2010 White Macabeo (Campo de Borja)\tMacabeo\tBorsao\tLT_90_Points\tTropical and forward, and with three months spent in oak, the wine offers some resin and vanilla both on the nose and in flavor. Tastes sweet, honeyed and nutty, with banana and melon notes. An easy drinker that will do best if well chilled.\n16071\tSpain\tVi?ña Zaco\t84\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Bilbainas 2008 Vi?ña Zaco  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Bilbainas\tLT_90_Points\tUltratight cherry and plum aromas create a lean red fruit profile. The palate is extra crisp and sheer, with piercing raspberry then a wash of oak flavor. Paper thin on the finish, with freshening acids and a final blast of oak.\n15597\tSpain\tMercedes Eguren\t81\t13\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Eguren 2007 Mercedes Eguren Sauvignon Blanc (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tSauvignon Blanc\tBodegas Eguren\tLT_90_Points\tModest on the nose, and then very little after that. The flavors are basic lime and citrus, and the feel is tangy and lemony sharp. Generic, with little to no varietal character.\n15601\tSpain\tBrunus\t81\t30\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPortal del Montsant 2005 Brunus Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tPortal del Montsant\tLT_90_Points\tNot all of the new wines that we see from up and coming regions like Montsant are good. This one is a lean, burnt and minty offering with an odd baked, nutty character. Not up to standards.\n15604\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t81\t22\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMonasterio de las Vi?ñas 1999 Gran Reserva Red (Cari?ñena)\tRed Blend\tMonasterio de las Vi?ñas\tLT_90_Points\tMature for Cari?ñena, but it's still a hard wine with juniper and other narrow aromas. The palate is almost sour, with tight tannins and noticeable astringency.\n15606\tSpain\tOak Aged\t80\t17\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tReula 2003 Oak Aged Tempranillo-Merlot (Cari?ñena)\tTempranillo-Merlot\tReula\tLT_90_Points\tBest on the nose, but sharp and narrow as can be on the palate. Cranberry and sour cherry flavors dominate, while the finish is astringent. No amount of swirling and saving is going help it much.\n12716\tSpain\tParvus\t88\t18\tCatalonia\tAlella\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlta Alella 2014 Parvus Chardonnay (Alella)\tChardonnay\tAlta Alella\tLT_90_Points\tMelon and peach aromas are fresh and come with a touch of vanilla. This is a well-made, solid Chardonnay with good body and fresh acidity. Flavors of apple, melon and spice finish with a touch of oaky cinnamon and a somewhat waxy texture.\n16233\tSpain\t\t87\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFerrum 2011 Albari?ño (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?ño\tFerrum\tLT_90_Points\tAromas include dry apricot and papaya with a hint of cider. This is on the soft side in feel, with dilution along with apple-based acidity. Flavors of nectarine and peach finish monotone. Drink immediately or wait for a fresher 2012 version.\n16072\tSpain\tCosme Palacio Vendimia Seleccionada\t84\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Palacio 2008 Cosme Palacio Vendimia Seleccionada  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Palacio\tLT_90_Points\tHarsh and nervy on the nose, with early aromas of horseradish and chemical that subside with airing. The palate is medium in size, with grabby tannins and dry, oaky flavors mixed with herbal berry notes. Finishes resiny and short.\n16079\tSpain\tOld Vines\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPontecilla 2009 Old Vines Tempranillo (Calatayud)\tTempranillo\tPontecilla\tLT_90_Points\tDark, crusty and minty on the nose, with obvious oak. The palate is tannic as a drill, with hard blackberry and herbal flavors. Toasty and peppery tasting on the finish, which is tough and drawing in feel.\n16083\tSpain\tOld Vine\t84\t13\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra de Viento 2008 Old Vine Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tSierra de Viento\tLT_90_Points\tHerbal up front, with pine aromas in addition to berry and plum.

In the mouth, this young wine is crisp, tannic and a touch citric. Wild berry flavors dance alongside peppery spice notes, while the finish is zesty, a touch bitter and hot.\n14720\tSpain\tOrganic\t82\t8\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVicente Gandia 2010 Organic Verdejo (Spain)\tVerdejo\tVicente Gandia\tLT_90_Points\tA bit off course as Verdejo goes, with spritz to the palate and then mealy citrus and persimmon flavors.

Pag??s 2005 Cartesius Red (Empord?ÿ)\tRed Blend\tCeller Arch?? Pag??s\tLT_90_Points\tSmacky and hard right away, with compact black cherry aromas. Shows lots of gusto in the mouth but no elegance or touch.

This has a grabby, tannic palate and burnt, herbal, earthy black-fruit flavors. Saltiness and blackened notes are to be found on a clampy finish.\n14731\tSpain\tCuatro\t81\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas y Vi?ñedos Noe 2010 Cuatro Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tBodegas y Vi?ñedos Noe\tLT_90_Points\tDamp, mealy aromas offer a touch of melon. The palate, however, is tart and metallic, with sour citrus flavors and a weird note of burnt popcorn on the finish.

A resiny mouthfeel leads to a savory palate with more wood and corn flavor than fruit. The finish has a smooth feel and lasting oaky flavors.\n18118\tSpain\t\t89\t25\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNita 2011 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tNita\tLT_90_Points\tA wiry, minty nose with aromas of herbs, compost and strawberry is pushy and direct. In the mouth, this feels grabby and tight, with driving tannins. Flavors of baked berry, carob and herbs finish with a prune-driven character, heat and choppy tannins.\n14491\tSpain\t\t84\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTrencal?ýs 2013 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tTrencal?ýs\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of tomato sauce and red-wine vinegar create sharpness on the nose.

Finca Rableros Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Somontano)\tTempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon\tBodega Otto Bestu??\tLT_90_Points\tMildly horsey on the nose, with alfalfa, reedy fruit and grilled beef aromas. The palate is wet and lean, with good acidity and a dose of heat, while the flavors of cherry tilt toward medicinal and weedy without fully going there. Basic Tempranillo-Cab Sauvignon with a green streak.\n17542\tSpain\t\t86\t18\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDaniel Belda 2014 Verdil (Valencia)\tVerdil\tDaniel Belda\tLT_90_Points\tPowdery melon aromas are soft and easy. This is varietal Verdil, a white grape indigenous to the Valencia region, and it's standard in weight and acidity. Mild orange, melon and yeast flavors finish short as a whistle burst.\n18129\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRam??n Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky, toasty and dark on the nose, this value-priced Rioja delivers plenty for the money. On the palate, it is smooth and ripe, with integrated tannins and proper acidity. Flavors of earth, loamy berry, plum and vanilla are supple and medium in intensity.\n18136\tSpain\tCarlota\t89\t35\tNorthern Spain\tEmpord?ÿ\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOliver Conti 2009 Carlota Red (Empord?ÿ)\tRed Blend\tOliver Conti\tLT_90_Points\tThis opens with staunch green aromas that shout out bell pepper and herbaceous. But give it air and this Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend comes around to show spicy baked-berry flavors on a tannic, full-bodied frame. On the finish, it's herbal, stout and round, with leafy flavors to go with dark-fruit notes. Drink through 2018.\n15062\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCVNE 2006 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCVNE\tLT_90_Points\tA lot is going on up front; there's cassis, raisin, prune and dill aromas. Medium to full in the mouth, with lively berry, plum and spice flavors. Not too sweet and fairly long and earthy on the finish. A pure example of Rioja Reserva.\n17568\tSpain\tEl Circo Acr??bato\t87\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCari?ñena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos 2015 El Circo Acr??bato Garnacha (Cari?ñena)\tGarnacha\tGrandes Vinos y Vi?ñedos\tLT_90_Points\tFloral plum and black cherry aromas are nice and fruity. A bright, juicy, simple palate holds flavors of plum, blackberry and chocolate. While nothing sticks out on the finish, this Garnacha ends nicely and overdelivers.\n17809\tSpain\t\t84\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?ña Egu??a 2013  Rioja\tTempranillo\tVi?ña Egu??a\tLT_90_Points\tStalky, leathery berry aromas are a bit lacking in purity.

It has a mix of spice, toast, citrus, almond and melon flavors. It spreads out on the finish, tasting spicy and cidery.\n14557\tSpain\tVarietales\t89\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaron De Ley 2012 Varietales  (Rioja)\tGarnacha\tBaron De Ley\tLT_90_Points\tThis red-fruit-dominated Garnacha smells of earthy cherry and plum along with orange peel.

Following the nose's lead, this is mellow on the palate, with raspberry and cherry flavors that are, once again, a bit sweet in character. A controlled, candied finish is consistent with what came before it.\n14300\tSpain\tSelecci??n Familia\t86\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFern?­ndez G??mez 2012 Selecci??n Familia White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tFern?­ndez G??mez\tLT_90_Points\tApple and mineral aromas are fresh yet simple in nature.

At the back are sophisticated tones of leather, tobacco and light touches of spice that give the wine depth and elegance. The most interesting aspect, however, is the mouthfeel that shows firm but beautifully ripe tannins that will help the wine age 10 years or more.\tVigna Paganelli Riserva\tGT_90_Points\t115\tTuscany\tBrunello di Montalcino\t\t\tSangiovese Grosso\tIl Poggione 2007 Vigna Paganelli Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino)\n6437\tSpain\tThis Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum. The palate is huge and tannic but luxurious, and the flavors of tobacco, cedar, lemon peel, spice and black fruit set up a finish with espresso, black cherry and a wall of tannins. Drink now through 2018.\tTermanthia\tGT_90_Points\t200\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\tTinta de Toro\tNumanthia 2009 Termanthia  (Toro)\n6262\tUS\tLeonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbecƒ??a more complex blend than the 2009. It opens with a lovely floral aromaƒ??a bouquet of clover and white flowersƒ??then heads for the dark side, with black cherry and cassis.

It's notable for the tight, nervous feeling that acidity and minerals combine to stimulate, and the finish is very dry. There is, fortunately, a great heart of sweet tropical fruit, like the purest golden mango pur??e, ripe and succulent and honeyed. Terrific now, but such is the balance that this could be one of those Chardonnays that changes in interesting ways over the next 5ƒ??6 years.\tQuail Hill Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t55\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\tChardonnay\tLynmar 2011 Quail Hill Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley)\n6455\tUS\tThough quite different stylistically from the 2009, this is just as good. The structure in 2010 is noteworthy for its high acid focus. There are streaks of berry and cassis, with touches of smoke and espresso. This is a wine to cellar while you are drinking up the delicious 2009.\tLevitation\tGT_90_Points\t40\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tSyrah\tSleight of Hand 2010 Levitation Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))\n6456\tUS\tIt's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style.\tThe Enchantress Old Vine\tGT_90_Points\t28\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tChardonnay\tSleight of Hand 2010 The Enchantress Old Vine Chardonnay (Yakima Valley)\n6458\tUS\tThis is big in fruit, big in tannins and big in the overall impression it leaves. It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H. Smith Winery, whose Pinot Noirs were magnificent and scored highly. This one seems a little heavier than Smith used to produce.\tCinghiale Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t75\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\t\tPinot Noir\tDel Dotto 2009 Cinghiale Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\n6460\tFrance\tFirm, concentrated and solid, this has a tight core that's surrounded by sweeter dark-plum fruit.

A floral top note gives way to firm, dark, cassis and blackberry flavors. Light notes of herb, anise and earth are introduced and set comfortably into the lengthy finish.

The palate fulfils that promise not only with generosity but counters it with gorgeous grapefruit freshness and a lovely zesty texture that makes this very appetizing. The flavors are zingy, clean, ripe and very, very long. It is the grapefruit spice that gets you in the end.\tLindberg Reserve\tGT_90_Points\t51\tKremstal\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\tGr?¬ner Veltliner\tSalomon-Undhof 2015 Lindberg Reserve Gr?¬ner Veltliner (Kremstal)\n8552\tUS\tThough this is their appellation blend, Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli don't hold back, offering elegant aromas of rose petals, purple flowers, rich pomegranate fruit, rusty strawberries and light vanilla on the nose. The palate begins with a light cranberry-raspberry flavor that deepens into tart mulberry before showing dried rose petals, uncrushed clove and a lava-rock minerality.\tSeven Leagues\tGT_90_Points\t46\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tScar of the Sea 2014 Seven Leagues Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)\n8294\tUS\tBeet and dark cranberry juice make for a very deep red-fruit entry to this bottling that is lifted by bay leaf, thyme and anise on the nose. It's easy, clean and refreshing in a lighter style on the sip, with dried strawberry and red plum spiced up by star anise and fennel.\tCave Block Reserve\tGT_90_Points\t49\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tWrights Station 2013 Cave Block Reserve Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)\n8917\tPortugal\tA big-hearted, fruity wine. With its ripe tannins and red berry fruits, this red is certainly powerful, but it manages to keep its balance, finishing ripe and sweet.

Sparkling (Cr??mant d'Alsace)\n4514\tUS\tThe producer's Russian River Valley fruit comes from the Winside Vineyard, planted long ago by Anne Moller-Racke and Joe Nugent. It astounds in this must-have wine, complex and ridiculously velvety in texture.

A textbook Barolo, this opens with scents of mature berry, leather, underbrush, tobacco and an elegant trace of fragrant blue flower.

The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar.

Deeply concentrated, complex and creamy, it's loaded with citrus and stone fruits, honey and butterscotch, yet remains lifted by defining acidity.\tLucille Late Harvest\tGT_90_Points\t18\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tViognier\tStottle 2011 Lucille Late Harvest Viognier (Yakima Valley)\n6268\tUS\tDense and extracted, this dark, loamy Pinot Noir is concentrated and challenging. The fruit is black, compact, and sheathed in flavors of loam. Layers are tight and a bit unyielding.

Christopher 2007 Appassionata Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\n6270\tUS\tThis is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.\tLimited\tGT_90_Points\t150\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSilverado 2009 Limited Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\n6729\tUS\tThis Brut-style wine feels extraordinarily refined in the mouth, with a silky, airy texture.

It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins. Not a long-term ager, but should hold for 6 years, and is easy to find, with more than 13,000 cases produced.\tCinq Cepages\tGT_90_Points\t75\tCalifornia\tSonoma County\tSonoma\t\tCabernet Sauvignon\tChateau St. Jean 2004 Cinq Cepages Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma County)\n8922\tFrance\tThere's an explosion of rich, intense fruit here: dried prunes, black plums and even some licorice.

This luscious wine, gold in color, is so rich, so intense as to be almost overwhelming. It is so young still all rich fruit, peaches, apricots with a touch of ginger. The wine, with its background of considerable acidity, will develop slowly; drink from 2020.\tGrand Cru\tGT_90_Points\t60\tLoire Valley\tQuarts de Chaume\t\tRoger Voss\tChenin Blanc\tCh?›teau Pierre-Bise 2011 Grand Cru  (Quarts de Chaume)\n4786\tItaly\tBrawny and forward, it leads with alluring fragrances of blue flower, underbrush, forest berries, balsamic herbs and leather.

Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is young now, with hard tannins that interfere with the fruit. The fruit is intensely concentrated with cherry compote and cassis flavors, while new oak's vanilla and toast are proportionate to the wine's volume. A worthy followup to the 2009, and a wine to cellar for 8ƒ??10 years, if not longer.\tHarmonie\tGT_90_Points\t120\tCalifornia\tPine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak\tSonoma\t\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCapt?¯re 2010 Harmonie Red (Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak)\n4067\tItaly\tAromas of ground pepper, clove, mature plum, black currant and charred earth emerge on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc blend, with a whiff of game.

Layers of cherry, currant, cedar and cinnamon fill the flavor profile, and a long finish completes the package.\tEstate\tGT_90_Points\t55\tCalifornia\tAnderson Valley\t\tJim Gordon\tPinot Noir\tPanthea 2012 Estate Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)\n7504\tCanada\tThis irresistible, lightly frizzante and utterly refreshing wine is a gem. Orange flesh and rind has a slightly candied potency, with outstanding purity, focus and length. In spite of the sweetness, it retains offsetting minerality and acidity, making it a perfect ap??ritif or brunch wine.\tMoscato d'Osoyoos\tGT_90_Points\t20\tBritish Columbia\tOkanagan Valley\t\tPaul Gregutt\tMoscato\tLaStella 2013 Moscato d'Osoyoos Moscato (Okanagan Valley)\n8090\tUS\tCrafted from Wente clone grapes from Charles Ranch, this label is the passion project of longtime wine industry player Tony Lombardi, who manages the much larger Kosta Browne brand. Barrel-fermented in neutral oak this wine offers heady Tahitian vanilla and lemon curd around green apple skin and lemon. The palate is both creamy and crisp, the finish reasonably powerful.\t\tGT_90_Points\t36\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tChardonnay\tLombardi 2012 Chardonnay (Sonoma Coast)\n8092\tPortugal\tMerlot and Syrah join Tinta Roriz in this impressive wine.

Dried herb and pencil lie beneath bigger, bolder swathes of blackberry and cherry. This wine has a large presence but shows structure and balance.\t\tGT_90_Points\t30\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\tCabernet Sauvignon\tStack House 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\n7764\tUS\tFloral and wet-stone aromas are followed by tangy kiwi and jicama flavors keeping to a nicely dry profile.

The palate features lively lemon notes on a very slender, brisk and fresh palate, along with a tiny bit of spritz. It shows a depth of fruit: a wine for lovers of subtlety. The crisp apple-peel finish is totally moreish.\tAnning\tGT_90_Points\t19\tThermenregion\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\tWeissburgunder\tStadlmann 2016 Anning Weissburgunder (Thermenregion)\n7767\tUS\tHigh-toned aromas of blackberry, aniseed, macerated cranberry, motor oil and flower lead to rich full-bodied cranberry and blackberry flavors that bring a sense of hedonism.\tStevensBlackTongue\tGT_90_Points\t32\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

It opens with intense aromas of blackberry, black plum and boysenberry that are hit with spicy notes of black pepper, cured meat, leather and Thin Mint. The plush and concentrated palate is like crushed velvet in texture, with gripping yet balanced tannins to support the rich, dense black-fruit flavors. The finish transitions from black cherry and boysenberry fruit to menthol, followed by lingering cocoa nib and charred oak tones.

Aromatically brooding at present, it shows intricate notes of barrel spice, thyme, coffee, cranberry, black tea and red and black fruit. The palate is tightly wound, with bright acid and lightly chewy tannins that need some time in the cellar to stretch their legs. Best from 2021 to 2030.\t\tGT_90_Points\t95\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLeonetti Cellar 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\n9766\tArgentina\tA studly Malbec sourced from the Altamira section of the Uco Valley, then aged 18 months in new French oak. Much of this wine is fermented in plastic bins (not tanks), and the affiliated intensity grabs your attention. The blackberry flavors are potent and backed by heavy chocolate and toast. Lots of mouthfeel and power, with tannic grab. This wine can age several more years.\tCatena Nicasia Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t110\tMendoza Province\tUco Valley\t\tMichael Schachner\tMalbec\tBodega Catena Zapata 2004 Catena Nicasia Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley)\n9768\tUS\tAn interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins. From an organic-certified vineyard.\t\tGT_90_Points\t40\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\tMerlot\tAdastra 2004 Merlot (Carneros)\n9770\tGermany\tThis is an exotic, flashy wine, marked by layers of ripe, sweet tropical fruit.

This is his inaugural release. Both fruit ripeness and meaty depth are here in abundance, with a complex mix of tree fruits and stone fruits, streaks of earth and a fine layering of chocolate. This is a wine you excavate as much as drink; it's full of surprises.\tBasalt Block\tGT_90_Points\t45\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tBrittan Vineyards 2006 Basalt Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\n7035\tSpain\tTeso la Monja is the new Toro winery from the Eguren family of Rioja fame (former owners of Numanthia-Termes in Toro), and it's proof that no beat has been missed since they sold out to Mo?®t Hennessy. Expect dark, intense black fruit aromas and flavors mixed with heat, tannin, cola and spice. Some oak creeps out on the finish, but overall this is a lovely, bullish Toro. Drink now through 2014.\tAlmirez\tGT_90_Points\t22\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\tTinta de Toro\tTeso La Monja 2007 Almirez  (Toro)\n7037\tUS\tDoesn't have quite the sheer ravishing power of the winery's Trace Ridge Cabernet, but this Cab-based Bordeaux blend is nuanced and possibly more complex and Bordeaux-like. The flavors are of currants, blackberries, cherries, anise and cedar, aged in 78% new French oak. Give it until 2011 to mellow.\tHighlands Estates Trace Ridge\tGT_90_Points\t75\tCalifornia\tKnights Valley\tSonoma\t\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tKendall-Jackson 2007 Highlands Estates Trace Ridge Red (Knights Valley)\n7039\tUS\tThis is a late-harvest dessert wine blend of S??millon and Sauvignon Blanc. It's very rich and very sweet and very easy to like. Backed up with firm acidity, it shows extraordinarily ripe flavors of pineapples, apricots, oranges, honey, cr??me br?¯l??e, vanilla bean, buttered toast and cinnamon spices.\tBotricelli\tGT_90_Points\t40\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\tSemillon-Sauvignon Blanc\tMiraflores 2006 Botricelli Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (California)\n6703\tUS\tJammy aromas and concentrated grape and blackberry flavors pack a lot of fruitiness into this full-bodied and velvet-textured wine. The ripe and almost sweet berry and plum notes gush forth with gusto while the firm, grippy texture keeps the mouthfeel nicely dry and helps clear the palate for the next bite or sip.\tBechthold Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t29\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\tCinsault\tOnesta 2012 Bechthold Vineyard Cinsault (Lodi)\n6704\tUS\tCrushed bricks, rose petals, red currants and grape syrup are sprinkled with elegant black spices in this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot by Steve and Chrystal Clifton. The palate is silky, redolent with mulberry and tart plums skins, amped up by sagebrush and thyme. It's perfect for a variety of foods.\tAlisos\tGT_90_Points\t32\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tRed Blend\tPalmina 2011 Alisos Red (Santa Barbara County)\n6707\tItaly\tStunning aromas of rose, violet, licorice, Asian spices and mature dark-skinned fruit waft out of the glass.

Textured and complex, it gives a squeeze of blood orange that lingers and remains fresh through the finish. It's from the owner's estate vineyard, sought after by many other producers and made by Siduri's Adam Lee.\tRos?? of\tGT_90_Points\t20\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tBucher 2014 Ros?? of Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\n6710\tFrance\tAnother terrific value from the Costi??res de N??mes, this features exquisite scents of grilled herbsƒ??think thyme, rosemary, lavenderƒ??with ripe blueberries and roasted meat.

The palate dries up with red plum and flashes of strawberry set against shaved clove spices. It's layered in flavor but softly textured.\tClassico\tGT_90_Points\t24\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tRed Blend\tToccata 2013 Classico Red (Santa Barbara County)\n7771\tAustria\tRipe notes of black cherry rise from the glass. The richness of the fruit is also apparent on the fleshy palate, where cherry notes fill out into red and black juiciness, with just a touch of the variety's telltale pepper. This wine is almost bouncy and reveals its firm grip and freshness only on the finish that echoes long.\t\tGT_90_Points\t\tBurgenland\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\tBlaufr??nkisch\tUmathum 2015 Blaufr??nkisch (Burgenland)\n7519\tFrance\tComing from the warmer Aube region, Laurent's Chardonnay offering is ripe and hinting at yellow fruits while also retaining a steely, mineral character.

It is rich and full of brooding dark plum and dense with structure. Dominated by Touriga Nacional, it has that variety's perfumed character which is balanced by the smoother Touriga Franca and Tinta Roriz. It is obviously a wine to age, so drink from 2018.\tReserva\tGT_90_Points\t25\tDouro\t\t\tRoger Voss\tPortuguese Red\tQuinta das Carvalhas 2012 Reserva Red (Douro)\n7523\tUS\tYoung, tight and compact, this is all about red fruits and red licorice. There's a dash of peppermint as well, on the way to a smooth, milk-chocolate finish. This seems sure to continue to improve through 2020 or more.\tGregory Ranch\tGT_90_Points\t60\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\t\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tBergstr??m 2013 Gregory Ranch Pinot Noir\n6453\tFrance\tWith that extra concentration that comes from low-yielding old vines, this has great depth of flavor. It has an apple flavor and crisp, citrusy acidity as well as a more toasty character. Complex and certainly ageworthy, this should keep for at least five years.\tLes Vieilles Vignes Montmains Premier Cru\tGT_90_Points\t54\tBurgundy\tChablis\t\tRoger Voss\tChardonnay\tPascal Bouchard 2010 Les Vieilles Vignes Montmains Premier Cru  (Chablis)\n9771\tUS\tA very fine example of Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, showing the elegance and complexity wines from that Sonoma County region can attain. Soft and intricate in tannins, the wine shows a m??lange of blackberry, currant, cherry, sweet dried herb and smoky flavors that are delicious now, and should hold well for several years.\t\tGT_90_Points\t40\tCalifornia\tAlexander Valley\tSonoma\t\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJoseph Family 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)\n9773\tFrance\tWines from Morey-Saint-Denis should be opulent in 2005, and this wine has opulence in spades. It fills the mouth with rich red plums, red cherries and some cranberry juice to give an edge of dryness. Maybe complexity is edged out by all this juicy fruit, but the tannins do firm up the wine, which should certainly age 10 years or more.\t\tGT_90_Points\t93\tBurgundy\tClos de la Roche\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tBouchard A??n?? & Fils 2005  Clos de la Roche\n8291\tNew Zealand\tAt almost half Cabernet Franc (49%), this is slightly leafier than what most producers are pulling out of the Gimblett Gravels. The balance is Cabernet Sauvignon (39%), with small amounts of Merlot (9%) and Malbec (3%). The tobacco, chocolate and cassis notes are carried by medium body and a firm, dry texture.

The 2015s from proprietor Sam Neill (yes, the actor) are a big step up from the 2014s. This bottling, from the Bannockburn subregion, offers bold notes of black cherries, plum and cola.

The palate is wonderfully zesty and the gorgeous grapefruit freshness harnesses all the ripe fruit into a driven force of joy. This is concentrated, juicy and utterly moreish.\tEhrenfels Reserve\tGT_90_Points\t44\tKremstal\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\tGr?¬ner Veltliner\tProidl 2015 Ehrenfels Reserve Gr?¬ner Veltliner (Kremstal)\n5669\tUS\tDeep color and lots of concentration make this full-bodied wine stand out. It has smoky, black-peppery aromas along with ripe but not sweet blackberry and black-cherry flavors. Firm tannins add texture. This boldness needs rich food for a pairing.\tReserve\tGT_90_Points\t37\tCalifornia\tSierra Foothills\tSierra Foothills\tJim Gordon\tBarbera\tNaggiar 2014 Reserve Barbera (Sierra Foothills)\n5671\tAustria\tWonderfully heady hints of yuzu play about the nose. The palate, on the other hand, is characterized by ripe juicy mirabelle plums.

The palate shows light, tangy cherry juice, fennel, crushed olive and peppery spice. It will work well for fans of this style, but there's not enough there to entertain the mainstream Pinot Noir fan.\tFiddlestix Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t43\tCalifornia\tSta. Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tRyan Cochrane 2014 Fiddlestix Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta.

As fine as the 2005, the 2008 is a stylish wine that also packs a firm punch of dense fruit, firm tannins and mouthwateringly juicy acidity.

The flavors are driven by ripe lemon and cling to a woolly line of citrus pith. The wine makes the mouth water strongly on the finish, creating an interesting sipping experience.\t\tGT_90_Points\t26\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tGrenache Blanc\tConsilience 2012 Grenache Blanc (Santa Barbara County)\n6238\tFrance\tThis ripe and creamy wine is both rich and fruity.

However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, cr??me de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar.

The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency.

It comes from an east-facing block, planted to a suitcase clone. Exotic, rich red and black berry and cinnamon form an alliance of balance and mouthwatering seduction. The oak and tannin are fully in sync, while a salty, meaty finish provides additional decadence.\tThe Traveler\tGT_90_Points\t155\tCalifornia\tFort Ross-Seaview\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tWayfarer 2014 The Traveler Pinot Noir (Fort Ross-Seaview)\n4902\tPortugal\tMade from one of the great white grapes of Portugal (perhaps in the world), this rich wine, with its floral character, ripe yellow fruits and touches of wood and toast, is impressive and opulent.

It is dry and tightly crisp, compared with the brut nature cuv??e also made from Pinot Noir. The ripe red fruits give a fruity character that balances the dryness. Like many really dry Champagnes, it needs to age to soften the intensity of the acidity, so drink this bottling from 2017.\tRos??

The palate reveals ripe berry and spice with notes of pipe tobacco and while the acidity is tame the wine is massively tannic. Hold this for a few more years, but drink it before 2020.\tBussia\tGT_90_Points\t92\tPiedmont\tBarolo\t\tKerin Oƒ??Keefe\tNebbiolo\tBarale Fratelli 2009 Bussia  (Barolo)\n4740\tUS\tThis clear and bright cranberry-red wine sports a pungent nose with spice, cranberry, mocha and light cherry scents and flavors.

The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.\tHarvest Reserve\tGT_90_Points\t18\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\tMerlot\tMirassou 1997 Harvest Reserve Merlot (California)\n4744\tUS\tSpice and melons illuminate the nose; the wine displays amazing concentration, with deep, syrupy peach and apricot fruit, and a bit of sugar and toasted coconut in the finish.

It's very similar to the regular bottling, with lots of ripe, fancy fruit, but it's oakier, with 50% new American barrels. What really distinguishes it, though, is its balance. The only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that the tannins are so soft, and the acidity so low, that it's a bit flabby. Most people won't notice or care.\tWinners Circle\tGT_90_Points\t25\tCalifornia\tCentral Coast\tCentral Coast\t\tSyrah\tBridlewood 1998 Winners Circle Syrah (Central Coast)\n4971\tItaly\tYou don't see much Syrah from the Veneto in northeast Italy, but Cicogna shows that the variety does have a future here.

It's dry, crisply acidic and complex, with the cherry-berry flavors assisted with notes of earthy herb and mushroom. A lovely wine now, and should gently develop over the next six years.\tSlice of Heaven\tGT_90_Points\t60\tCalifornia\tSta. Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\t\tPinot Noir\tBabcock 2010 Slice of Heaven Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)\n6680\tUS\tFor the 2011 vintage, Winemaker Charles Thomas blended Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from the winery's 280-acre biodynamic and organically farmed estate in the heart of Rutherford. The effect is memorable, the wine pungent in red plum and cherry. Light, layered and elegantly smooth on the palate, it has a backdrop of black pepper and clove.

The mouthfeel is plush and filling, with generous yet structured tannins and ample acidity that frame the rich dark fruits.

It's firmly structured and packed with black-fruit flavors, resulting in a crushed-velvet texture. The finish is long and evolving, and this should continue to develop well through 2022.\tFusion V\tGT_90_Points\t60\tStellenbosch\t\t\tLauren Buzzeo\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tDe Toren 2014 Fusion V Red (Stellenbosch)\n6331\tFrance\tAn unusually fresh herbal note of lemon balm hovers on the nose. The palate, however, counters this with ample honeyed sweetness. The lemon-balm note flashes here and there and the residual sugar frames notions of ripe Mirabelle plum beautifully. This will work well as a counterpoint to sharp blue cheeses with its medium-sweet finish.\tGloeckelberg Grand Cru\tGT_90_Points\t34\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\tPinot Gris\tDomaine Fernand Engel 2015 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace)\n6333\tNew Zealand\tFrom one of Marlborough's top producers, Framingham's 2015 Pinot offers a heady concoction of dark berry fruit, cola, meat, black olive and earthy forrest floor.

There is more stuffing, especially apparent in the nose and also in the mouth, than in the winery's varietal blends. The back end of the wine suggests bread and chocolate, light hints of toasted almond and cinnamon spice.\tSolstice\tGT_90_Points\t40\tWashington\tHorse Heaven Hills\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tRed Blend\tEdmonds Winery 2007 Solstice Red (Horse Heaven Hills)\n2299\tGermany\tVerging on orange in color, this intensely botrytized wine from one of Germany's unique grape varieties is thick, almost chewy with extract and sugar. Dried apricot aromas lead into orange marmalade flavors with an almost burnt, caramelized quality.

Lemon notes intensify on the palate, where they attain a lovely textural feel of pith and zest. A slender wine, it still carries a hint of yeast on the midpalate, but is subtle, clean, slender and fine.

The 2007 Brunello delivers sweet oak tones that drive the initial bouquet and are soon followed by bright cherry, vanilla bean, sweet mocha and rum cake. Pretty balsam notes at the back will undoubtedly increase and evolve with age.

This 60-40 blend of Cabernet and Syrah (aged in cement tanks and barrique) shows dark, inky notes of black fruit and graphite.

Along the way there's flavors and aromas of prune, earth, leather, spice and Mediterranean terroir. It's also bringing tobacco and leaf notes to the table. A fun, different wine that goes nicely with tapas.

This reserve, with a tiny case production, is denser and more tannic, but shows the same charm. It's a fat, fleshy wine, with luscious black cherry tart, cola and caramelized oak flavors.

There's a dark, brooding subtext despite the obviously mellowing oak flavors and a core of spice that will fulfil its promise with some further time in bottle. The concentrated power here comes from partially dried grapes. The tannins are pliable and supple.

But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors.

Dark fruit, fresh herb and abundant barrel-spice aromas are followed by bountiful, restrained black-fruit flavors that carry through the finish.\tD2\tGT_90_Points\t45\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tDeLille 2013 D2 Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\n3383\tUS\tBig and bold in character, this full-bodied and abundantly tannic wine looks black to the rim and smells like pencil shavings, leather and wood smoke. The flavors are dry but enticing, with dark chocolate, charred beef and black cherry. It needs until at least 2022 to peak.\t\tGT_90_Points\t42\tCalifornia\tYorkville Highlands\tNorth Coast\tJim Gordon\tPetite Sirah\tMeyer Family Cellars 2012 Petite Sirah (Yorkville Highlands)\n3385\tSpain\tThis five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025.\tFinca Malave??na\tGT_90_Points\t28\tNorthern Spain\tEmpord?ÿ\t\tMichael Schachner\tRed Blend\tPerelada 2012 Finca Malave??na Red (Empord?ÿ)\n5498\tSpain\tThis dynamite Tempranillo hails from a top producer and a top vintage. Aromas of toasty oak, graphite, coffee and blackberry feed into a rugged but generous palate fueled by firm tannins.

Drink from 2015 through 2025.\tChristina\tGT_90_Points\t90\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\tTinto Fino\tAstrales 2010 Christina  (Ribera del Duero)\n5500\tUS\tEven at more than four years of age, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot remains huge in primary cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. The tough, astringent tannins make it essentially undrinkable now. Yet its underling wholesomeness and balance guarantee development through 2021, and possibly longer.\tThe Discussion\tGT_90_Points\t125\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tDuckhorn 2009 The Discussion Red (Napa Valley)\n4692\tChile\tAromas of Italian herbs like basil and oregano blend with eucalyptus and black-fruit scents. Chunky, clampy, bumpy tannins define the mouthfeel on this Cab-Syrah blend, while roasted flavors of plum, berry and chocolate finish herbal, meaty and warm.

Very slight and soft strawberry and squeezed lemon aromas kick off the experience, followed by light red fruit sliced by tangy kumquat on the palate. The flavors are not particularly complex or unique, but the sip is fascinating.\tRos?? of\tGT_90_Points\t24\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tStephen Ross 2015 Ros?? of Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)\n4698\tSpain\tFresh, pure berry aromas don't mess around.

Shows the variety's powerful tannins and fruit, with a velvety texture framing jammy blackberries, blueberries, carob, vanilla, exotic spices and smoky cedar. Will develop for many years, but there's no reason not to drink it now.\t\tGT_90_Points\t55\tCalifornia\tCalistoga\tNapa\t\tPetite Sirah\tChase 2009 Petite Sirah (Calistoga)\n2048\tAustria\tFrom slate and limestone vineyards, this is an intense wine, full of tropical fruit flavors, spice, toast and hints of ginger.

The sweet cherry and raspberry fruit is encircled with a coat of fancy smoked oak.

Layers of graphite and slate give purity, linearity and clarity to this austere and elegant expression. Earthy tones, as well as forest berry flavors, appear on the long finish.\tCosta di Bussia\tGT_90_Points\t50\tPiedmont\tBarolo\t\t\tNebbiolo\tTenuta Arnulfo 2006 Costa di Bussia  (Barolo)\n5765\tFrance\tFlinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.\tCalcaire\tGT_90_Points\t55\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tAnne Krebiehl?ÿMW\tPinot Gris\tDomaine Zind-Humbrecht 2013 Calcaire Pinot Gris (Alsace)\n5766\tFrance\tFlinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously.
